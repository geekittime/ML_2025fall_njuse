Each commit contains a pretty lengthy description to try to make things as clear as possible. Rather than reproduce that here, the short version is that this PR contains two bug fixes:
1) Fixes #13106 which deals with type augmentation being broken in the ecosystem when enabling the ""moduleResolution"": ""bundler"" typescript option. This is due to the export map requiring full filenames with extensions, even though they are almost never provided as such
2) Fixes an issue with the types being unavailable from a `""type"": ""module""` context when using ""moduleResolution"": ""bundler"" | ""node16""",2023-10-24 22:55:38+00:00,2023-12-06 07:52:19+00:00,2023-12-06 07:52:19+00:00,0,0,86,1871.0,1016.9447222222223,1

This pull request's issue originates from a specific problem mentioned in https://github.com/vuejs/pinia/issues/1800 . Due to the potential for callHook to modify the upper-level scope's behavior of collecting effects, it subsequently leads to incorrect effects being torn down when stopping in the wrong scope.

**Other information:**

`@vue/compiler-sfc` optionally uses Prettier and it is not compatible with Prettier v3.

But `prettier` is not listed in the `package.json`.

It wasn't a problem with Prettier v2 because prettier is [optional dependency of `component-compiler-utils`](https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/blob/82a37174990e31eaec609887a0ec262f06b454dd/package.json#L69). So Prettier is installed anyway and everything works.

But if some project has `Prettier@3`, then `@vue/compiler-sfc` uses project's prettier and fails.

There was the same issue early in [component-compiler-utils](https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils). See:
- https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/commit/aea1b79765f0f6d688e64b7698d5ff62862002d1
- https://github.com/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/pull/89

This PR specifies Prettier as an `optionalDependency` of `@vue/compiler-sfc`. With specified dependency, it will use `prettier@2` even if a project has `prettier@3`.

P.S. I used the same versions as it was in the `component-compiler-utils`. It seems it has the same code.

**Alternative solution:** make `@vue/compiler-sfc` compatible with both `Prettier@""1 || 2""` and `Prettier@3`. The problem is that it will make the compile function async.",2023-07-19 17:06:06+00:00,2023-12-06 07:49:42+00:00,2023-12-06 07:49:42+00:00,0,0,58,2553.0,3350.7266666666665,1

**Other information:**

In v2.7 (for now I'm using, it's 2.7.14), when using `defineComponent` with `props`, method-based `emits` and `setup` like the code snippet below:

```ts
defineComponent({
  props: {
    foo: Number
  },
  emits: {
    'update:foo'(value: number) {}
  },
  setup(_, { emit }) {
    emit('update:foo', 123) // OK
    emit('update:foo', '123') // expect error, but passed
    emit('bar') // expect error, but passed
  }
})
```

the second and the third `emit` call in `setup` won't raise any TypeScript type-check errors.

However, if I change `emits` to using arrow functions like this:

```diff
defineComponent({
  props: {
    foo: Number
  },
  emits: {
-   'update:foo'(value: number) {}
+   'update:foo': (value: number) => {}
  },
  setup(_, { emit }) {
    emit('update:foo', 123) // OK
    emit('update:foo', '123') // error is raised as expected
    emit('bar') // error is raised as expected
  }
})
```

This PR fixes this by removing the `Props` generic from `ComponentOptionsWithProps`. In Overload 3 of `defineComponent`, `props` is always defined so there's no need to check if `props` is defined or not by using `HasDefined` type, then we inlined `ExtractPropTypes<PropsOptions>` (the default type of the removed `Props` generic).",2023-04-20 04:02:20+00:00,2023-12-26 02:25:50+00:00,,0,0,45,2560.0,5998.391666666666,0

12989,closed,fix: `inBrowser` needs to check existence of `document`,cutsin,"## Motivation

Use vuex+vue2 in chrome extension MV3 will be throw some env errors like: `document is not defined`.
Reason:
- In MV3, `document` object has moved to [Offscreen API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/migrating/to-service-workers/#move-dom-and-window), alsot setting env to `VUE_ENV=server` will have not effect.
- In MV2 works fine

This PR can fix it.

12988,closed,Remove index signature from CSSProperties,sarayourfriend,"This allows for actually using strongly typed hyphen properties in CSS. In the current version, the comment above it is wrong. This was likely copied from the React types and never fixed to reflect the fact that the index signature was included back: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts#L1577-L1584

The reason for including this signature is not clear to me and doesn't appear to be in the code history. Does the project require some hyphen properties to be available? In that case, then Vue should define those explicitly and I can make the changes in this PR. Otherwise, this index signature makes the types measurably worse for everyone else using Vue's types in their own projects with strict CSS property types.

Notably, this also differs from Vue's own guide on CSSProperties: https://vuejs.org/api/utility-types.html#cssproperties

With the current implementation, the instructions on that documentation page are essentially useless, no one would ever need them (unless they're doing something like Houdini and adding new non-hyphen CSS properties).

There is a component called `v-switch` that is placed inside a `transition-group` element. The `v-switch` component has a directive called `v-foo`, accepts a boolean prop called `isOn` and switches its template root according to the value of `isOn`. The `v-foo` directive has an inserted hook that should be called to ensure that the binding logic is refreshed whenever the template root changes.

fix #12799 

problem:
[Vue warn]: Error in setup: ""TypeError: Cannot define property __v_rawToReadonly, object is not extensible"" TypeError: Cannot define property __v_rawToReadonly, object is not extensible

demo:
https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-2-7-v-rawtoreadonly-demo-10ix10?file=/src/App.vue

reason:
Readonly function sets new property on object recursively. This may cause this error when meeting frozen variables. Ofcourse this error can also happen when using readonly directly on frozen objects.

solvement:
This fix can simply solve the issue by checking the extensibility of target, and keep the temp proxy at the same time, but leaving existing proxy cache useless. The main reason is the ""isReadonly"" judgement, but it's difficult to change this basic feature, and the frozen target may still contain not frozen things? As this case may happen rarely, this fix is enough now and willing for future improvements.

Example cases are arguments external 3rd party components, or internal components. The default props only need to be extracted when using `defineComponent` when using `DefineComponent` type this is not necessary to do and breaks props that are unions.

12616,closed,fix(hooks): add renderTracked/Triggered merge strategy,chearon,"Hi, the `renderTracked` and `renderTriggered` hooks almost work (Options API) but it looks like a merge strategy was never added. `callHook` expects `$options[hook]` to be an array

Here is a demo: https://jsfiddle.net/qvmz2dps/

Thought it was straightforward enough not to add tests, but I can do so

12612,closed,Define component improvements,yyx990803,"Previously, `defineComponent()` types were ported from `@vue/composition-api`, which has diverged from Vue 3 behavior over time.

This PR re-aligns `defineComponent` type inference with Vue 3 as much as possible, including `mixins` and `extends` support. The main difference being that events declared via `emits` will not have corresponding `onXXX` props because there is no such behavior in Vue 2.

But directives can't:

  render (h) {
    return h(MyComponent, {
      directives: [{ name: 'my-directive' }]

This already mostly works in 2.7 beta, but there is no type definition and it is overwritten in `<script setup>` components

Ideally, all style-only-commits should be put on this list.

The ""move to typescript"" is not trivial by itself, but most of the
additions/deletions are style changes. So I think it's safe and more
reader-friendly to exclude it.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

HTML tags written using some uppercase letters (i.e. `<H1>` or `<Span>`) will stop rendering their children. This happens because those tags are considered components by the `maybeComponent()` function, so after applying these changes their children will be considered the contents of its default slot. As native HTML tags doesn't have slots, they won't be rendered. This is explained in more detail in the attached video.

The recommendation in this case is to write the standard HTML tags always in lowercase (in fact, in Vue 3 a ""failed to resolve component"" warning is displayed when an uppercase tag is used, even when it's still rendered).

**The PR fulfills these requirements:**

- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch
- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where ""xxx"" is the issue number)
- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup
- [x] New/updated tests are included

This duplicates https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/12402 due to a branch deletion mistake.

Tom from Codecov here. The original intent of the build was to only run Codecov on non-PRs. But it seems like every commit has an associated PR now. The [Codecov page](https://app.codecov.io/gh/vuejs/vue) shows no commits for the past year, and viewing any build of a commit in that timeframe (e.g. [6e22f770](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/vuejs/vue/784/workflows/dd6d5796-ada9-44ff-9b4b-27dd8bb9558a/jobs/18103)) will show that `CIRCLE_PULL_REQUEST` and `CI_PULL_REQUEST` are set.

In any case, no coverage report has been uploaded in quite some time. I realize that this will change the PR experience for users, so happy to change this to whatever makes the most sense for Vue.

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/Stuk/jszip/blob/master/CHANGES.md"">jszip's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>v3.7.1 2021-08-05</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix build of <code>dist</code> files.
<ul>
<li>Note: this version ensures the changes from 3.7.0 are actually included in the <code>dist</code> files. Thanks to Evan W for reporting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>v3.7.0 2021-07-23</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Use a null prototype object for this.files  (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/766"">#766</a>)
<ul>
<li>This change might break existing code if it uses prototype methods on the <code>.files</code> property of a zip object, for example <code>zip.files.toString()</code>. This approach is taken to prevent files in the zip overriding object methods that would exist on a normal object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>v3.6.0 2021-02-09</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: redirect main to dist on browsers (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/742"">#742</a>)</li>
<li>Fix duplicate require DataLengthProbe, utils (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/734"">#734</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fix 'End of data reached' error when file extra field is invalid (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/544"">#544</a>).</li>
<li>Typescript definitions: Add null to return types of functions that may return null (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/669"">#669</a>).</li>
<li>Typescript definitions: Correct nodeStream's type (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/682"">#682</a>)</li>
<li>Typescript definitions: Add string output type (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/666"">#666</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>v3.4.0 2020-04-19</h3>

<ul>
<li>Change browser module resolution to support Angular packager (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/614"">#614</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>v3.2.2 2019-07-04</h3>
<ul>
<li>No public changes, but a number of testing dependencies have been updated.</li>
<li>Tested browsers are now: Internet Explorer 11, Chrome (most recent) and Firefox (most recent). Other browsers (specifically Safari) are still supported however testing them on Saucelabs is broken and so they were removed from the test matrix.</li>
</ul>

<li>Corrected built dist files</li>
</ul>

<li>Fix deprecated Buffer constructor usage and add safeguards (see <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/Stuk/jszip/pull/506"">#506</a>).</li>

I watch the code,then i find callhook function include ```pushTarget,popTarget```,it referenced in [https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7596](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7596).

However, ```$data.property``` will only collect in ```updateComponent wathcer``` dep dependencies when it was used in `<template>`。so，why use ```pushTarget,popTarget``` in callhook?

I delete code,and it was alert one times

Yesterday, I was going through the reactivity code, and I stumbled upon this line where the code has the comment ""stabilize the subscriber list first"", It took me a minute to look through the mdn docs for Array.slice() to find out it returns a shallow copy, and I thought it will save someone a little bit time if I added that too to the comment, and created this PR. if this gets accepted it will be my first ever open source contribution.

Move the code base from flow to typescript

### Plan 

This PR plans to convert the current flow code into typescript and type some of the code, avoiding changes to javascript output code.

This PR will stay open for a while, there's many pending PR which need to be merged before this. 


## Status

- [x] convert all the js files to typescript 
- [x] replace flow types with typescript
- [x] make build and CI work 
- [ ] introduce typing to plain JS files",2021-04-03 14:15:25+00:00,2022-05-20 07:21:15+00:00,,0,1,25,1005.0,9881.097222222223,0

**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)

- [x] Feature


**Information**

Bringing [@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) code to `vue` core.

## TODO

- [ ] ensure the build is working
- [ ] add type testing (similar to vue 3)
- [ ] support for `composition-api` same as the plugin 
- [ ] `setup` should work out-of-box
- [ ] vue 3 typescript types
- [ ] Backporting vue 3 types and tests - changes must be minimal to allow copy&paste in the future.
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with the current v2 types

## Possible improvements by having access to vue 2 reactivity internals

Those are some issue currently the plugin have because we don't have access to some of the internals, it still needs some exploratory work and might not be possible.

- [ ] Prevent `watchEffect` infinite loop https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api/pull/522 
- [ ] `reactive` array  https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api/pull/522 
- [ ] `map` and `set` reactivity similar to `vue-next` https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api/pull/509

<details>
<summary>Changelog</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md"">handlebars's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v4.7.7 - February 15th, 2021</h2>
<ul>
<li>fix weird error in integration tests - eb860c0</li>
<li>fix: check prototype property access in strict-mode (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736"">#1736</a>) - b6d3de7</li>
<li>fix: escape property names in compat mode (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1736"">#1736</a>) - f058970</li>
<li>refactor: In spec tests, use expectTemplate over equals and shouldThrow (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1683"">#1683</a>) - 77825f8</li>
<li>chore: start testing on Node.js 12 and 13 - 3789a30</li>
</ul>
<p>(POSSIBLY) BREAKING CHANGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>the changes from version <a href=""https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020"">4.6.0</a> now also apply
in when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods
can be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633"">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties
from your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you. Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we only bump the patch version despite mentioning breaking changes.</p>

**What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (check at least one)

- [x] Bugfix
- [ ] Feature
- [ ] Code style update
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Build-related changes
- [ ] Other, please describe:

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No
- [x] Not sure if this is considered a breaking change 

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:


**The PR fulfills these requirements:**

- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch
- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where ""xxx"" is the issue number)
- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup
- [x] New/updated tests are included

**Other information:**
Look at this codeexample:
```ts
import { AsyncComponent, Component } from 'vue'
const a: AsyncComponent = () => ({
  component: new Promise<Component>((res, rej) => {
    res({})
  }),
})

const b: AsyncComponent = () => ({
  component: () =>
    new Promise<Component>((res, rej) => {
      res({})
    }),
})
```

The first example is like in the docs https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html#Handling-Loading-State and the second example should not work (I also looked at the implementation and I think this would not work).

The types are currently like such that the first example throws a type Error and the second throws no error. This PR fixes that.

**(Hopefully) convincing reason:**
There are a lot of properties missing in the plain `Element` interface that are perfectly available when referencing these properties (in my case it was `offsetHeight`).
_As far as I know_ there is no reason why these values can't be typed as the more elaborate `HTMLElement`, but I'm by no means a Vue-expert.

Since this change is trivial I opted to directly create a PR instead of waiting for a response on an issue.",2020-11-24 20:42:08+00:00,2020-11-24 22:11:19+00:00,,0,0,42,1461.0,1.486388888888889,0

**Other information:**

I found that `new ( Vue.extend({}) )()` and components inside will work right, just void to `new Vue({})` (root case), things will be ok.

So at least fix the `propsData` line, that will cause bug when prop is declared but no prop pass in (vm will get function on proto, not undefined nor default), that's easy to fix, and can't avoid like above in userland.

Key in `Object.prototype` does not work right for `props` / `computed` before this PR.

NOTICE: here still leave `constructor` that can't use, even after I replaced all `constructor` to `_constructor` in the source code, if I remove line `Vue.prototype.constructor = Vue` (in `/src/core/instance/index.js`) for the last step, here will always be one test fail (`ci/circleci: test-e2e`).

with a component template like this

triggering the event, e.g.
`<my-component @my-keyup.enter=""onMyKeyup""/>`
the `onMyKeyup` receives the `$event`, but not `var1` and `var2`

hope this PR resolves the issue.

Bundle includes `.DS_Store` files https://unpkg.com/browse/vue@2.6.12/src/ 
 These files are macOS artifacts and clearly not intended to be included in the release modules.

The problem stems from how npm handles bare directories.  The `files` entry in package.json merely says `""src""`.  The npm client includes all files in the src directory, including those in `.gitignore`.  The proposed fix tells NPM not to include `.DS_Store` files.

11597,closed,fix(compiler): support decode all HTML entities in the value of prop and attribute (fix #8895),JuniorTour,"### Profit：

1. Close #8895, #8805, #10121 and many issues about decoding HTML entities.
2. Go a step further to support decoding all the HTML entities in the value of prop and attribute. Ensuring consistent behavior between Vue.js and browser. Solving the HTML entities decode issue once and for all.
3. Optimizing the particular logic of fixing #3663 and #6828, simplify the code, improve the robustness.

**Other information:**
When defining directives dynamically, the typescript compiler throws an error due to the missing index signature for string keys. Current local usage:

```
import Vue, { DirectiveFunction as VueDirectiveFunction, DirectiveOptions as VueDirectiveOptions } from 'vue';

interface DirectiveOptions extends VueDirectiveOptions {
    [index: string]: VueDirectiveFunction | undefined,
}

const indexEntries: Array<string> = ['bind', 'update'];
const directiveOptions: DirectiveOptions = {};
const directiveFunction: VueDirectiveFunction = () => {
    console.log('directive');
};
for (const index of indexEntries) {
    directiveOptions[index] = directiveFunction;
}

Vue.directive('img-circle', directiveOptions);
```

Usage after change:

```
import Vue, { DirectiveFunction, DirectiveOptions } from 'vue';

const indexEntries: Array<string> = ['bind', 'update'];
const directiveOptions: DirectiveOptions = {};
const directiveFunction: DirectiveFunction = () => {
    console.log('directive');
};
for (const index of indexEntries) {
    directiveOptions[index] = directiveFunction;
}

Vue.directive('img-circle', directiveOptions);
```

**Other information:**

My project is a Webpack build helper CLI which attaches react dev tooling to the `window` global (although it is not consumed in the browser.) 

The presence of the `window` global causes vue builds to fail since the duck typing on `inBrowser` only checks for the presence of `window` and then assumes the presence of `document` related properties (like `navigator`).

https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/a9a303009a4267b7f12b956741b4e34dfdc6566f/src/core/util/env.js#L7

The specific error this results in is a type error here: 

https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/a9a303009a4267b7f12b956741b4e34dfdc6566f/src/core/util/env.js#L10. 

The slightly more stringent check introduced in this PR avoids this type error. While my particular use case is admittedly niche I think this change is still a general improvement for Vue.

This is a drive-by contribution, and I had trouble testing on my host.  When I ran npm test, everything succeeded/passed until attempting to start a webserver, since I already have something listening on port 8080 that I didn't want to shut down.  I tried _npm test --port 8111, which looked like it was going to work, but there are a bunch of hard-coded instances of :8080 under e2e/specs that I think are the cause.

UserAgent variables `isPhantomJS` and `isChrome` in `vue\src\core\util\env.js` was no longer used since:
- Replace `isPhantomJS` with`isChrome`: [2019-1-11: refactor: better solution for async edge case.](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/3504d7f6d6c8f5bf156fa9242bf54f502c077520#diff-f2722526eac8096c360952e2ffa057f9)

But now, they still exist and will be bundled into the dist version, eg: `vue\dist\vue.min.js`. 

These userless code can be simplified, And reduce production version size slightly, So I made this PR.

**Other information:**

Chromium browsers (and Safari) trigger a `keydown`/`keyup` event on autocomplete. An `Event` object without `key` or `keyCode` is generated.
Vue, when listening with modifiers, is triggering the callback even if the modifier key doesn't match the `undefined` keyCode of the event.

Current behaviour: https://codepen.io/zupolgec/pen/RwWRxdK
New behaviour: https://codepen.io/zupolgec/pen/qBONxMj

Try autocompleting the first field: in the first demo is counted, in the second demo is ignored.

11287,closed,fix(src/server/render.js): Fixes component directives rendering,trecenti,"fix #10733

SSR render does not execute directives attached to a component, this is happening because during SSR render we're using the component's root element as a source for rendering, thus there's no directive associated with it.

This fixes it by copying directives from the Component declaration to the Component's root element, while rendering the root element it references the Component instance vnode to properly render it's modules applying the directives.

11112,closed,fix(types): make $refs undefined possible,WORMSS,"Added undefined as a return type of $refs as it was quite hard to convince typescript that something COULD be undefined if you type in a ref that doesn't exist,
I also changed the two array statements from `Element[] | Vue[]` to `(Element | Vue)[]` because it's not guaranteed that they are ALL Elements or they are ALL Vue components. (Very likely, yes, but not always)
For example
```html
<template v-for=""(a, index) of b"">
  <div v-if=""index % 2 === 0"" ref=""test""></div>
  <my-component v-else ref=""test""></my-component>
</template>
```

11107,closed,fix(core): fix sameVnode for async component,contribu,"I found and fixed a vdom bug related to async component and SSR.
I originally noticed this bug on my closed project using Nuxt.
The minimal reproduction code is included in test.

## Phenomenon

Throw when hydrated pending async component is patched by v-if=""false"" node.
(version: 2.6.11)

## Cause

1. v-if=""false"" node is represented by comment node
2. sameVNode returns true when asyncPlaceholder and comment are compared.
3. patchVNode executed for asyncPlaceholder and comment.
4. comment doesn't have asyncFactory but asyncFactory.resolved is accessed.

## Fix

Fix sameVNode to return false when asyncPlaceholder and comment are compared.

After looking at the performance of one of my apps, I noticed, the function, that took the most time summed up was `getType()` , defined in [1] taking 200ms. I noticed the regular expression getting created for each call and measured again including the proposed improvement, which took the time down to 150ms. To make sure I changed it back to confirm and it again timed at 200ms.

I found that for some reason `any` type in `new (...args: any[]): T & object`  prevent to pick up prop type in the newer TypeScript version. Replacing it with `never` fixes the problem.

The meaning of the code is not changed as a function argument type is contravariant and `never` type is of bottom type, that is, the entire `new (...args: never[]): T & object` type accepts any constructor type having any argument types which the original code intends.",2019-10-30 03:52:18+00:00,2019-10-30 14:45:29+00:00,2019-10-30 14:45:29+00:00,1,0,47,1759.0,10.886388888888888,1

I added the new issue template configuration options. Awesome new feature 🎉

> You can customize the issue template chooser that people see when creating a new issue in your repository by adding a config.yml file to the .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder.

> If you prefer to receive certain reports outside of GitHub, you can direct people to external sites with `contact_links`.

> You can require contributors to use issue templates by setting `blank_issue_enabled` to `false`. If you set `blank_issue_enabled` to `true`, people will have the option to open a blank issue.

10729,closed,fix(core): fix casting symbol values to strings in the prop type check warning,jansiegel,"
If the default value of the prop in the prop definition doesn't match the type of the prop, it should throw a warning, but instead it throws a `TypeError` when the default value is defined as a `Symbol`, e.g.:
```
testProp: {
    type: Number,
    default: Symbol('foo')
};
```
*expected*: `Invalid prop: type check failed for prop ""testProp"". Expected Number, got Symbol`
*currently*: `TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a number`

This PR changes the symbol->string casting from `"""" + value` to `String(value)`, as the first approach doesn't work well with symbols.
Also, I've added an `isSymbol` check, so it doesn't try to read the ""value"" of the symbol in the message warning + tests.

# Descriptions

With current type definitions, it's extremely difficult for developers to pass props to children components when writing TSX since there's no exposed property that JSX can handle as element attributes properties.

![2019-01-27 22 45 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8381075/51801762-4e3b1380-2285-11e9-8262-18136c6afbe1.png)

This PullRequest achieves 2 things.

    * Creates new property `_attrs` to the `ExtendedVue` type so it can be used inside `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.(Examples are below)

    * Transform non-required props into optional properties of `props` interface.


## Example

Given these 2 children components...

```js
// PrimaryButton.tsx
import Vue from 'vue'

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'Primary Button',
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      required: true as true
    },
    color: String
  },
  computed: {
    style(): string {
      return `color: ${this.color || 'blue'};`
    }
  },
  render() {
    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>
  }
})
```

```js
// SecondaryButton.tsx
import Vue from 'vue'

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'Secondary Button',
  props: ['color', 'label'],
  computed: {
    style(): string {
      return `color: ${this.color || 'blue'};`
    }
  },
  render() {
    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>
  }
})
```

and prepare `shims-tsx.d.ts` like this

```js
// shims-tsx.d.ts
import Vue, { VNode } from 'vue'

declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Element extends VNode {}
    interface ElementClass extends Vue {}
    interface ElementAttributesProperty {
      _attrs: any
    }
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      [elem: string]: any
    }
  }
}
```

Property completion works as expected.

![2019-01-27 22 55 58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8381075/51801907-2e0c5400-2287-11e9-95db-6d99dfa59ddb.png)

Type error warned as expected.

![2019-01-27 22 56 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8381075/51801908-2e0c5400-2287-11e9-8953-9f0357920edb.png)

and no more errors with correct props declaration 👍

<!-- PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE -->

## Trusted Types
[Trusted Types](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types) ([spec](https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/), [introductory article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/trusted-types)) is a new experimental DOM API implemented within the WICG , with a working [Chrome implementation](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5650088592408576).

The API creates a few new objects available on the global object in the browser, like most other web APIs ([impl in TS](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/trusted-types/index.d.ts) and in [Closure compiler](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/blob/master/externs/externs.js)).

Under certain conditions, controlled by a HTTP header (analogous to Content-Security-Policy behavior), the API can enable the enforcement - then it changes the signature of several DOM API functions and property setters, such that they accept specific object types, and reject strings. Colloquially, DOM API becomes strongly typed.

For example, with Trusted Types Element.innerHTML property setter accepts a TrustedHTML object.

Trusted Type objects stringify to their inner value. This API shape is a deliberate choice that enables existing web applications and libraries to gradually migrate from strings to Trusted Types without breaking functionality. In our example, it makes it possible to write the following:

```javascript
const policy = TrustedTypes.createPolicy('foo', { 
  createHTML: (s) => { /* some validation*/; return s} 
});

const trustedHTML = policy.createHTML('bar');
anElement.innerHTML = trustedHTML

anElement.innerHTML === 'bar'
```

The above code works regardless if the Trusted Types enforcement is enabled or not.

Reading from the DOM is unaffected, so Element.innerHTML getter returns a string. That's for practical reasons -- web applications read from DOM more often than they write to it, and only writing exposes the application to DOM XSS risks. Typing only the setters allows us to secure web applications with minimal code changes.

### Integrating Trusted Types to Vue
The integration is fairly simple as there are not many places which break when using Vue with Trusted Types. There one place though, which I am not sure if it's even called (couldn't trigger it myself). It's marked in a code with `TT_TODO: ...` comment. I hope someone can clarify this for me. **The PR doesn't introduce any breaking changes**. All of the code is applied only when the trustedTypes API is available in the global object.

**Other information:**
The PR adds support for Trusted Types only on client side, but it might be beneficial to use them also on server side. There is no DOM on server side, however we can check if the values are trusted before creating markup with dangerous attributes. This also makes the applications render the same thing on the server and on client. There is already a similar [PR for this for React](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16555).

If you would like to try this change there is a [really simple application](https://github.com/Siegrift/vue-example-app) with the instructions how to setup vue locally in which you can play with Trusted Types. Vue cli uses webpack for development which provides features like hot-reloading. This currently breaks, but the [PR is already fired and we are waiting for review](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/9426).",2019-09-06 14:44:33+00:00,2023-11-20 12:05:10+00:00,,0,0,43,4721.0,36861.34361111111,0

The majority of unit tests uses arrow functions for _describe_ and _it_ callbacks. This PR fixes the few that don't for a more consistent style.

As mentioned a while ago in another PR this option is deprecated in 2.x. If the maintainers have reservations against merging this PR then I think that at least we should provide a warning when _cache:false_ is used.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

Caching invalidation of computed properties will stop working in applications that use this feature. But as explained in the [migration guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/migration.html#cache-false-deprecated) these applications should use normal methods instead, which should have the same result.

Here, I will rephrase the issue, and explain my solution.

## What problem?

### Demos

Here are two demo for comparison.

1. [Vanilla vue.js warns when assigment in v-if happens](https://codepen.io/grandsong/pen/xoLxvM)
2. [My modified vue.js doesn't warn when assigment in v-if happens](https://codepen.io/grandsong/pen/PrKwQj)

Remember to open Dev Tools and check the Console.

The code in question is `<span v-if=""pet = person.pet"">`.

### What happens in vanilla vue.js?

vue.js doesn't check the content of the expression of a `v-if`.

To it, `pet = person.pet` is just an arbitrary expression.

It desn't care whether assigment happens in a `v-if`.

All if conditions will be compiled as ternary statements.

In the example, the compiled codes will be like:

  	((pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)

As a result, while the template is being rendered, at the beginning when the renderer meets this identifier `pet`, the **proxy** of vue instane (let's name it as `vm`) will automatically try to get `pet` as a property of the instance.

Of course it will fail. `vm.pet` has not been defined yet.
So, a **warning** will be thrown.

    [Vue warn]: Property or method ""pet"" is not defined on the instance but referenced during render.

Then, the renderer meets `= person.pet`, so it assigns the `pet` as a property of the vue instance, namely, `vm.pet = person.pet`.

After that, when it meets `pet` again in `pet.name`, it gets `pet` (namely, `vm.pet`) successfully.

If we would manually do the rendering in place of vue (without the help of the magical proxy and its get-handler), we will deal with codes like this:

    ((vm.pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${vm.pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)

A spoiler: `person` is different. It doesn't bother the proxy.

## Why do we need assigment in v-if?

Why do we need any shorthand (like `:` for `v-bind:`), or sugar syntax (`for in` instead of `for(var ..;..<..length;..++)`), etc?

Making life easier!

We can live with inconvenience. But we still ask for better life when we have chance.

#### The above demos

Without the assigment, the codes would become

    <span v-if=""person.pet"">{{person.name}}'s pet's name is {{person.pet.name}}.</span>

Well, looks completely tolerable...

But, what if the design is more complex?

    <span v-if=""person.pet"">
    	<span v-if=""person.pet.hunger > 0"">
    		{{person.name}}'s pet's {{person.pet.name}} needs to eat
    		<span> {{foodDict[person.pet.favFoodId]}}</span>
    		, which
    		<span v-if=""foodQtyInStore[person.pet.favFoodId]""> you have {{foodQtyInStore[person.pet.favFoodId]}}.</span>
    		<span v-else class=""color-warning""> is out of stock!<span>
    	</span>
    </span>

Compare it with

    <span v-if=""pet = person.pet"">
    	<span v-if=""pet.hunger > 0"">
    		{{person.name}}'s pet's {{pet.name}} needs to eat
    		<span> {{foodDict[pet.favFoodId].name}}</span>
    		, which
    		<span v-if=""foodQty = foodQtyInStore[pet.favFoodId]""> you have {{foodQty}}.</span>
    		<span v-else class=""color-warning""> is out of stock!<span>
    	</span>
    </span>


#### `slotScope`

And let's take another example - an example in the source of **vue.js itself**:

		function processSlotContent (el) {
		  let slotScope
		  if (el.tag === 'template') {
		    ...
		  } else if ((slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope'))) {
		    ...
		    el.slotScope = slotScope
		  }
		  ...
		}

(It purposely uses double brackets to fool lint-flow-types, which forbids assigment in if.)

Without the assigment, it would become

		function processSlotContent (el) {
		  let slotScope
		  if (el.tag === 'template') {
		    ...
		  } else if (getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')) {
		    ...
		    el.slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')
		  }
		  ...
		}

I don't know if it is OK for `getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')` to be called twice.
Probably not.

Maybe we still have to use assigment, just not in if-condition.

		function processSlotContent (el) {
		  let slotScope
		  if (el.tag === 'template') {
		    ...
		  } else {
			  slotScope = getAndRemoveAttr(el, 'slot-scope')
				if (slotScope) {
			    ...
			    el.slotScope = slotScope
			  }
			}
		  ...
		}

#### `if let`

Another thing we can analogize to is the `if let` in Swift.

See [Optional Binding](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html#ID333) if you haven't learnt it or don't quite recall.

Before I learnt this feature of Swift, I was very reluctant to assigment in if-condition.

Because it would remind me of my several stupid mistakes of `=` for `==` as well as my old time as a JS newbie.

I would rather write more codes (like the `slotScope` one) to avoid assigment in if-condition.

But Swift gave me a good lesson.
Smart people should embrace useful features when opportunity allows (designing a new language).

#### What about danger?

In pure JS, thanks to js linters, assigment in if-condition is not as dangerous as it used to be. Mistakes of `=` for `==` can be easily detected.

(That's why [#7631 warn when assignment in v-if in development mode](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7631) was closed by @posva.)

## Then, what's wrong with vue?

In vue, it is another story.

There is no way to easily create local variables yet.

So, even if I just want assignment outside v-if, I cannot assign at all.

(There is [a solution](https://github.com/posva/vue-local-scope) for `slot-scope`. But I seldom use slots.)

Whether we deserve such freedom is beyond this issue. Let's leave it and focus on assignment in `v-if`.

Please remember these fact:

- assignment in `v-if` **already** works

- the warning thrown is not very helpful

The warning is thrown, not because vue has a rule which forbids assignment in `v-if`, but because vue fails to recognize the identifier as a new one, which of course is not defined.

### And, bug?

And there can be possible conflict (I don't know if it can be called a bug/loophole):

If somehow the developer writes

		data() {
      return {
        b: false,
        pet: {
        	// some other pet
        	name: 'Tom'
      	},
        persons: [...]
      }
    }

Now, there is `vm.pet` (Tom) before the template is rendered.

So, when the renderer meets `v-if=""pet = perons.pet""`, it will happily get it!
And then, `vm.pet` will be overwritten and Tom will no longer exist!


### Compare `v-for`

`v-for` naturally contains assignment.

Although not mentioned in the doc, vue actually even ""[support destructuring assignment](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8780)"". It is a little secret.

So, what goes on with `v-for`? Why identifiers in it doesn't lead to warnings?

The answer is simple: compiled codes for `v-for` are functions, so that the identifiers are local varibles within the functions.

That's why you dont' see `vm.person.name` in the ""If we would manually do the rendering"" code:

    ((vm.pet = person.pet) ? `${person.name}'s pet's name is ${vm.pet.name}.` : `${person.name} has no pet.`)

This inspired me when I was trying to make a solution.

## What solution?

Simple.

You can see that I added/modified only very few lines below.

Quick explanation:

1. In ""parser/index.js"", `assignmentInIfRE` is define.

2. In `function addIfCondition`, `assignmentInIfRE` is used to find the identifier, and store it as `condition.alias`.

3. In ""codegen/index.js"", save the original compiled result to `ternaryExp`.

4. If `condition.alias` exists, add a declaration of the identifier. Then, wrap the codes as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression).

With IIFE, it works in a way very similar to the optional binding (`if let`) in Swift.

### BTW, Why `alias`?

The parser for `v-for` stores identifiers (i.e. `person`) as `alias` of the node.

I don't know what uses are of these aliases, but I like the choice of name.

## Hey, no test yet? How dare you!

Sorry.
I tried to follow the instruction but I failed to do the test.
Twice.

I run `yarn`, then I got stuck. It shows several ""waiting..."" **forever**.

I had to stop it manually, and a rerun was no luck either.

Anyway, I've already made a **working** modified vue.js, in **my Demo 2**.

So I guess it is highly likely for my simple solution to run well with this pull request, too.

Besides, there might be problems that I cannot anticipate.
Today it was the first time I've delved into the source of vue.

Real experts may be needed for polishing this feature.

10074,closed,Force ArrayConstructor to be a any[] typescript type (fix #9935),Domino9697,"## Issue

When using an Array prop in a Vue component with TypeScript, TypeScript breaks because the
JavaScript ArrayConstructor is transpiled to a {}[] typescript type that is for some reason more
general than any[]. Since the type is more general, the component is not using the correct component
overload function declaration. The idea here is to force the JavaScript ArrayConstructor to be
transpiled to any[] type to fix the issue.

fix #9935

**Other information:**

In the current declaration, `index.d.ts` has `export as namespace Vue` which exposes all exported types in `index.d.ts` in global namespace. So the user can access them by just writing like `Vue.ComponentOptions` without import statement.

But this declaration is actually not correct because the `Vue` constructor type is declared under `default` which is correct in ESModule bundle but UMD bundle.

```ts
new Vue({}) // This provides compilation error in current type.

new Vue.default({}) // No compilation error.
```

To declare Vue constructor as just `Vue` in global namespace, we need to write `export as namespace Vue` with a common js export. So I've add `umd.d.ts` and do that in that file.",2019-04-23 13:42:31+00:00,2019-04-25 03:18:08+00:00,2019-04-25 03:18:08+00:00,0,0,59,2013.0,37.59361111111111,1

Currently if we have a `.native` modifier applied to event handler on native HTML element, it will break the handler (you can find the minimal reproduction [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/m718j536yp)).

We had a discussion about it with @chrisvfritz and it was decided it would be a good solution to add a console warning for this case. This way we can warn people they are using `.native` incorrectly: it should be used only on components not on elements.

An ideal solution would be also making `.native` work on elements while throwing a warning but it might be a subject for another PR.",2019-04-17 05:39:40+00:00,2019-04-25 02:39:20+00:00,2019-04-25 02:39:20+00:00,0,0,71,1657.0,188.99444444444444,1

Vue component will not be recycled. because keep-alive cache vnode. and cached vnode will hold on to new parent vnode which will hold created vue instance. So we will use the updated hook to set all
cached vnode's parent to null. This pull request will fix #9842. In the original issue. it states that it relates to transition which is not true. It can be any vue component.Here is my local test.

9829,closed,fix(core): fix casting symbol values to strings in the prop type chec…,jansiegel,"…k warning

If the default value of the prop in the prop definition doesn't match the type of the prop, it should throw a warning, but instead it throws a `TypeError` when the default value is defined as a `Symbol`, e.g.:
```
testProp: {
    type: Number,
    default: Symbol('foo')
};
```
*expected*: `Invalid prop: type check failed for prop ""testProp"". Expected Number, got Symbol`
*currently*: `TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a number`

This PR changes the symbol->string casting from `"""" + value` to `String(value)`, as the first approach doesn't work well with symbols.
Also, I've added an `isSymbol` check, so it doesn't try to read the ""value"" of the symbol in the message warning + tests.

**Other information:**
Using `String.normalize()` is desirable when dealing with user-facing text inputs, considering that unicode strings that look the same on screen can sometimes be encoded differently and thus bring a bunch of problems later on (i.e. when trying to find duplicate strings).

Moreover, having to add `String.normalize()` every time is pretty much just as annoying as having to add `String.trim()` every time, so by that rationale I believe that adding this modifier to `v-model` makes just as much sense as having `trim` in there (which I very much appreciate!).

**Notes:**
- Sorry for not filing an issue first! I decided to just go for it since it's a pretty small modification. Hopefully this explanation is enough, but I can always add an issue later if needed.
- I'm pretty sure that I added all relevant tests and they all seem to have passed. I did experience an issue trying to run the ChromeHeadless instance on my PC, however, although I'm not sure if that test suite applies to this PR anyway (if it does please let me know and I'll try to get it fixed asap).
- I'm using the default `NFC` form of unicode normalization. It might be worth considering adding the other forms as well (`NFD`,`NFKC`,`NFKD`).

More informaton on `String.normalize()` and its usefulness can be found in the following links:

Fixed issue #9577.

The old modifier matching pattern is `/\.[^.]+/g`, It does not take into account that dynamic arguments may contain `.`，so I updated it and hope it is correct.

code example:

``` {javascript}
const before = /\.[^.]+/g;
const after = /\.[^.\]]+(?=\.|$)/g;

let s = 'name:[a.b].c.d';

console.log(s.match(before)); // ["".b]"", "".c"", "".d""]
console.log(s.match(after));    // ["".c"", "".d""]

fixed #9511 

In some cases, invokeWithErrorHandling will have nested calls, and Promise will independently catch multiple times, resulting in multiple calls to handleError.

Look at a sample code：

``` javascript
var p = Promise.reject('some err');

p.catch(() => console.log('1'));  // p = p.catch(...)
p.catch(() => console.log('2'));
```
The above code will output 1 and 2, but if you reassign the first catch call to p, it will not output 2.",2019-02-19 10:17:01+00:00,2019-02-21 19:01:54+00:00,2019-02-21 19:01:54+00:00,0,0,46,1759.0,56.74805555555555,1

# Descriptions
With current type definitions, it's extremely difficult for developers to pass props to children components when writing TSX since there's no exposed property that JSX can handle as element attributes properties.

![2019-01-27 22 45 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8381075/51801762-4e3b1380-2285-11e9-8262-18136c6afbe1.png)
 
This PullRequest achieves 2 things.
- Creates new property `_attrs` to the `ExtendedVue` type so it can be used inside `JSX.ElementAttributesProperty`.(Examples are below)
- Transform non-required props into optional properties of `props` interface.

## Example

Given these 2 children components...

```js
// PrimaryButton.tsx
import Vue from 'vue'

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'Primary Button',
  props: {
    label: {
      type: String,
      required: true as true
    },
    color: String
  },
  computed: {
    style(): string {
      return `color: ${this.color || 'blue'};`
    }
  },
  render() {
    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>
  }
})
```

```js
// SecondaryButton.tsx
import Vue from 'vue'

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'Secondary Button',
  props: ['color', 'label'],
  computed: {
    style(): string {
      return `color: ${this.color || 'blue'};`
    }
  },
  render() {
    return <button style={this.style}>{this.label}</button>
  }
})
```

and prepare `shims-tsx.d.ts` like this

```js
// shims-tsx.d.ts
import Vue, { VNode } from 'vue'

declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Element extends VNode {}
    interface ElementClass extends Vue {}
    interface ElementAttributesProperty {
      _attrs: any
    }
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      [elem: string]: any
    }
  }
}

9371,closed,perf: improve scoped slots change detection accuracy,yyx990803,"Ensure that state mutations that only affect parent scope only trigger parent update and does not affect child components with only scoped slots.

Implications:

- For optimal performance, scoped slots should always be preferred. (In v3 all slots are unified to work like scoped slots so that will be the default)

- In 2.6, any slots using the new `v-slot` syntax are compiled as scopedSlots internally. This doesn't affect the child if it's using template, since `<slot/>` can render both scoped and normal slots, but if the child is using render functions, it is recommended to always use `this.$scopedSlots`. It is safe to do so in 2.6 since all normal slots are proxied on `this.$scopedSlots` as well.

- Unfortunately, any child components with static slot content still need to be forced updated. This means the common use case of `<parent><child></child></parent>` doesn't benefit from this change, unless the default slot is explicitly forced into a scoped slot by using `<parent v-slot:default><child></child></parent>`. (We cannot directly force all slots into scoped slots as that would break existing render function code that expects the slot to be present on `this.$slots` instead of `this.$scopedSlots)",2019-01-25 20:04:18+00:00,2019-01-26 03:34:07+00:00,2019-01-26 03:34:07+00:00,0,0,52,1226.0,7.496944444444445,1

**Other information:**
The generator function for inline templates `genInlineTemplate ` did not prevent the generation of code when an invalid template was being introduced. 

The solution introduced is verifying the existence of the first child before checking for its type, this should prevent the application from crashing trying to access attributes in an `undefined` child variable.

TypeScript typings

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

This PR can break apps that use Vue.set/Vue.delete with incorrect types, but I wouldn't consider it to be a breaking change since the builds were already (unknowingly) broken before.
However, keys of type ""string"" may stop working without casting to a proper key type.

**The PR fulfills these requirements:**

- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch
- [x] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where ""xxx"" is the issue number)
- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup
- [ ] New/updated tests are included

**Other information:**

While using `Vue.set()`, it was possible to update a non-existing field on an object, or pass an object of incorrect type as value and break everything.
I've changed `Vue.set()` and `Vue.delete()` declarations to better match their intent: now it can only be used with correct types.

Before:
```typescript
let obj = { height: 100 }
Vue.set(obj, ""heigth"", 50) // typo in the field name is ignored, obj becomes { height: 100, heigth: 50 }
console.log(obj.height) // still prints ""100""
```
After:
```typescript
let obj = { height: 100 }
Vue.set(obj, ""heigth"", 50) // tsc error
```

Before:
```typescript
let obj: { width?: number } = { }
Vue.set(obj, ""width"", ""0px"") // field type is ignored, obj becomes { width: ""0px"" } while still typed as { width?: number }
if (typeof obj.width !== ""undefined"")
  obj.width.toFixed(10) // throws
```

After:
```typescript
let obj: { width?: number } = { }
Vue.set(obj, ""width"", ""0px"") // tsc error
```

I think that we can also remove the `Vue.set()`/`Vue.delete()` declarations with arrays, since `keyof` works on arrays as well.
This will become:
```typescript
export interface VueConstructor<V extends Vue = Vue> {
  // ...
  set<U, K extends keyof U>(objectOrArray: U, key: K, value: U[K]): U[K];
  delete<U>(objectOrArray: U, key: keyof U): void;
  // ...
}

**Other information:**

@yyx990803 I've found a solution to #9205 

It's a very simple addition, to the `vue-server-renderer` package that has tonnes of use-cases and actually makes the `vue-server-renderer` much easier to use, as it provides a template function to the bundle renderer template compiler.

This isn't a breaking change and doesn't really need any tests, as it is a user-provided function

It would be amazing if this could be added in **2.6**, so I could use it in my package

### Use cases
1. Allows head management within `single file components` (see #9205)
2. Allows async functions within the `template` option
3. Makes the `vue-server-renderer` templater much easier to use, and allows users to use javascript interpolations. For example: `<!--vue-ssr-outlet-->` becomes `${result}`

#### Bonus
I'm creating a serverside rendering templating engine for **Vue** that will use this feature. It includes:
- A super simple head management system that exists entirely within the `<template>`, like native html
- full server-side rendering with Webpack
- CommonJS based, so users can easily implement it into koa/express projects

This change fixes that.

Function accepts three types of argument: string, regexp or array.
If we check that arg is regexp and return after this, we can
make second check for array. If this is not array - we don't need to
call third check, because of we are using flow. It's possible just to
return simple expression.

On the current reactive system implementation, when a computed property depends on an array, its children object will also be registered to computed property's watcher as dependency.

When the watcher is torndown, the watcher iterates its dependencies (size `n`). The dependencies remove the watcher from their watcher list (size `m`). So it will cost O(n*m).

So it would become slow if there are many computed properties and a large array.

This PR change the watcher list in `Dep` object to object map to make the order linear. The entire order of the watcher teardown will be O(n).

There may be more overhead on `delete` operator. I'm not sure how it affects actual application though.",2018-10-13 17:18:46+00:00,2018-10-14 10:26:10+00:00,,0,0,85,2352.0,17.123333333333335,0
8925,closed,fix #8862: cannot watch unicode properties like 'a.中文',derek-li,"Hi all at Vue!

This pull request resolves the issue regarding watchers not watching unicode properties like 'a.中文'.

My method for resolving this case is to throw a warning when non-alphanumeric, $, or _ characters are detected. My reasoning behind throwing a warning instead of supporting special characters is that I think  supporting special characters would promote poor naming habits that could only make code more difficult to read and understand.

I'm pretty new to open source so any feedback would be awesome and please let me know if you'd like to see any changes or improvements!

**Other information:**

The convincing reason was explained at length over at #8106. I know this will not be merged, in fact I'm gonna close it myself. But I'm publishing this PR for reference for anyone else interested.

The initial need was for components, but when reviewing the code I thought the most elegant way to do this was by changing the `resolveAsset()` function to call a user function defined on the `$options` object:

```
getComponent(id: string, identifierSpellings: Object): void | Component | AsyncComponent
getDirective(id: string, identifierSpellings: Object): void | Directive
getFilter(id: string, identifiesSpellings: Object): void | Filter
```

The `identifierSpellings` object has normalized spellings in case the user needs it:

- raw: the way it was called
- hyphenated
- camelized
- PascalCase
- and a toString() method, which returns the raw version

The nice thing about this is that it gives all the power to the user, and enables him to do many things which aren't possible with the current api, and the biggest use case is to **lazily load async components only when they are needed.**

I know that to submit a decent PR, I'd still need to write tests and documentation... that is the next step.

Fixes #8798 

When you refer to `$refs`, the type if always something truthy, while it is possible that the value is `undefined`.
Without this change, one can refer to a `ref` that is `undefined`, but TypeScript thinks it is `Element` or `Vue`.

This PR added `undefined` type to the type of `$refs`. This way it is more type-safe when using `$refs`.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

`parseComponent('...', { pad: 'space' }).script.content` will contain code with base indent if SFC content has base indent. Also applies to styles or etc.

As #5058 and #5059, `pad: 'space'` is for character-oriented tools that calculate positions by distance from the beginning of the file instead of by line. This should be applied to source code itself, so I think it was buggy and breaking change is unavoidable.

Currently for older browsers (IE9~IE11) we cannot use `v-html` on SVG elements because they don't support `innerHTML` for SVG elements. While actually we can fix this without much effort and make it “just works”. As `innerHTML` is defined for `Element` interface (which `SVGElement` is derived from) [in the latest spec](https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#dfn-innerhtml), I think it's reasonable to add this for `v-html`.

**Other information:**

Related issues: #5310 #5756

Since it's a browser-specific fix and we don't run tests for IE locally, I created a repo to demonstrate the fix: https://github.com/Justineo/v-html-svg

* With latest `vue` on `unpkg.com`, see: https://justineo.github.io/v-html-svg/test-original.html
* After the fix, see: https://justineo.github.io/v-html-svg/test-fixed.html

I've tested and it should now work in IE 9~IE 11.

**Other information:**
Currently, when transforming `data.model` in `createElement` function, it does not check if the component is a functional component, causing a double update on `v-model`. This prevents double update on v-model in functional components by not transforming model when `Ctor.options.functional` is `true`.

**Other information:**

Currently, the return type of `default` option is annotated with `object` since it is used for generating fresh object for each component instance. But there is another use case for `default` option of function in [portal-vue](https://github.com/LinusBorg/portal-vue) which is for dynamically generating unique value as default.
https://github.com/LinusBorg/portal-vue/blob/develop/src/components/portal.js#L16

The current typing breaks `this` type inference when the `default` function returns non-object type. I just relaxed the return type to `any` to avoid breaking the inference.",2018-07-21 04:01:45+00:00,2018-09-18 02:33:58+00:00,2018-09-18 02:33:58+00:00,0,0,57,1445.0,1414.5369444444445,1

8422,closed,"fix(transition): check existence of `el.parentNode`, fix #8199",haoqunjiang,"Fix #8199 
If the new parentNode gets a `textContent` or `innerHTML` property during patching, the `transition` node would have been detached early, which means `el.parentNode` no longer exists.
So this existential check is necessary.

This is an imperfect fix because while errors are suppressed, transition animations still get lost.
It is due to the different mechanism of `v-html` and VDOM element patching. But fixing that would be much more complex and I don't think we'd bother fixing such an edge case.

This change allows to overwrite the defaults (e.g. `isUnaryTag`) for the `vue-server-renderer`. Which should allow to build some more advanced features (e.g. allow to render RSS). Also, it changes the initialization of the SSR `renderFunction` as it passes along the `isUnaryTag` to the creation of the `compileFunctions`.

8250,closed,fix(#7913): Prevent erroneous warning when using <slot> inside slot-scope,mpbarlow,"Because slotNodes inside a slot-scope context are already set to \_rendered = true after initial
render, the warning for duplicate slot presence always fires when a slot-scope prop change triggers
a re-render. With this change, the compiler tracks whether any slot-scoped elements have been
encountered yet at the point the slot is compiled. If so, the direct ancestors of the slot are checked
for slot-scope presence, and if one is found, the warning is supressed.

This is admittedly not a perfect solution, as within a slot-scope context the warning now does not fire even when there _are_ duplicate slots, but I couldn't find a good way to get around that.

fix #7913

**Description:**

Hi, 
When interpolating an object, it uses the JSON.stringify method instead of toString, which is normally the proper method to set a way to convert an object to a string. 
This PR allow you to use your custom `toString` method to render your object if it exists. It's tested (I've also added a test for toJson), and it should not be a breaking change.

Thanks you for your amazing work folks, and see you in Paris next month!",2018-05-22 06:51:05+00:00,2018-12-21 18:13:49+00:00,2018-12-21 18:13:49+00:00,1,0,79,1416.0,5123.3788888888885,1

Adds support for iterable object implementing [Symbol.iterator]()
It shouldn't have an impact for existing code because non iterable objects are not impacted.
Vue will have the same behaviour than a for...of expression for iterables. (actual interest for using iterables)
Allows us to pass an iterable directly to a template without giving internal properties or converting it to an array


I wrote 4 new tests. No existing tests needed changes.
All tests passed. I ran tests with PhantomJS (lack of Symbol support), Firefox and Chrome.

after adding the conditional statement, I confirmed that the problem was also resolved in the input tag.

This PR adds the `""sideEffects"": false` property in vue's `package.json` file. This allow's webpack (for those who want to opt-in to requiring vue's original source files (instead of the flattened esm bundles) and want to remove flow type through a babel-transform, then this will allow webpack to aggressively ignore and treeshake unused exports throughout the module system. 

In many cases this can yield hidden and surprising build time improvements and size reductions in the case that modules flattened from rollup aren't actually needed when webpack performs a scope analysis. 

The angular team has adopted this approach for the CLI yielding some strong build time speed for webpack (since unused exports are also not resolved, parsed, etc.). From my assessment of the module graph created, it looks that there are no sideEffects created against existing re-exports throughout the codebase, therefore even if a user did opt in on their own will, and remove flow types, there should be no danger of removing code that is needed and causing breakages. 

Overall, this already will not be a breaking change in any way but just provides extra benefits to those (and for the cli (if realized) when using webpack 4 and `mode: production`).

Happy to answer any other questions.

Please make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:
https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines
-->

This fixes a double escaping of literal class values in the SSR optimizing compiler by unescaping the value in `genClassSegments`.

This bugfix is very similar to https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7224. Literal class values get escaped twice during [`transformNode`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/79c0d7bcfbcd1ac492e7ceb77f5024d09efdc6b3/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules/class.js#L25) and [`flattenSegments`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/79c0d7bcfbcd1ac492e7ceb77f5024d09efdc6b3/src/server/optimizing-compiler/codegen.js#L240), causing the double escape.

fix #7859

portal-vue to not update when the contents of the slots updated. This
was because there were no reactive properties accessed when using $slots
and renders were only being triggered by calls to $forceUpdate when slot
contents changed.

This change makes $slots reactive, so updates are detected appropriately
regardless of where the slot is used.

Prevents `Property 'oldValue' is missing in type '{ name: string; value: string; }'.` when using directives in a render function (see test).

7974,closed,Allow for custom rule of blocks parsing,yassilah,"I am currently working on a Nativescript+Vue template, which includes a specific webpack config that allows for differentiated templates based on the target (web or native). Single file components are extremely useful and being able to add a custom rule to the parsing of their blocks would make it possible to write a single file containing a `native` template alongside a `web` template, both of which sharing the same <script> logic or <style> rules. So far, the only workaround is to change the 'vue-loader' in webpack but by adding this it would be possible to use the actual official 'vue-loader' and change only the necessary part.

**Other information:**
Hey, I am a member of a group of students (@LarsStegman, @PhilipeLouchtch, @TimSpeelman) that has been analysing Vue for the course Software Architecture. As part of this course it was suggested to create a contribution to reduce technical debt.
During this analysis we found that the filter parser was hard to understand,
this PR is supposed to remedy this by adding additional documentation.
String (single, double, template quoted) and regex matching have been overhauled to use a special method to seek the ending quote instead, this effectively behaves the same as the code did before.

We ran a benchmark with a weird filter string, the result of which indicated there is no degradation in performance.",2018-04-02 16:27:29+00:00,2018-10-22 19:51:03+00:00,,0,0,55,2035.0,4875.392777777778,0
7941,closed,feat(functional): add scopedSlots to context in functional components,posva,"Related #5381

We discussed this being added to 2.6.
It is nothing new, as `scopedSlots` already exist on `data`. The only reasons to add it are convenience and consistency with `slots` (although `slots` is a function).
If you have arguments for or against this feature, please share them 🙂

> **These modifications only take effects on Weex platform.**

This is a partial feature of recycle-list.

Because of there is no virtual dom in virtual components, the event handler can only be bind on the virtual component template, but the event handler should be executed in the virtual component context (refer to this [brief explanation](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000013697211#articleHeader13)). So at least two processes should be changed to support this feature.

**1. Using dynamic `this` for the event handler**

When compiling the `v-on` directive, the expression will be compiled into a handler function. Along with the `with(this){}` magic, the handler function's context (`this`) always be same as the render function. But it should be dynamic for virtual components, the real context of the event handler could be re-assigned at runtime.

To achieve this, I added an explicit `this` to the event handlers which are used in recyclable components.  ([platforms/weex/compiler/modules/event.js#L45-L60](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/blob/6be2fc83130c1aa1cf696800a2b7fb23eec9f6e1/src/platforms/weex/compiler/modules/event.js#L45-L60)) 

**2. Finding the expected context when invoking the event handler.**

At runtime, if an event is dispatched to a virtual component template, then find the real context by `componentId` and invoke the handler in the expected context. ([platforms/weex/runtime/modules/events.js#L48-L65](https://github.com/Hanks10100/vue/blob/6be2fc83130c1aa1cf696800a2b7fb23eec9f6e1/src/platforms/weex/runtime/modules/events.js#L48-L65))

**Other information:**

After #7302, there's an asymmetry in `defineReactive` for properties that have both a getter and a setter.  On initial creation, the value returned by the getter is not made reactive since #7302 makes sure not to fetch it and `observe(val)` is a no-op.  However, if the value is set again after the property has been made reactive, it is made reactive as well since `observe(newVal)` in `set` is not gated on missing a getter.  (The premise justifying the change in #7280 that ""why should we get the value of the property in walk, despite the fact, that it is used only if the property has no getter"" is wrong, as the value was used in the call to `observe` even if the property had a getter.)

With the present change, properties that _only_ have a getter will still not have their value fetched and won't be made reactive, which should continue to satisfy @DeyLak's needs IIUC.  However, properties that have both a getter and a setter will continue to behave like they did before, being made recursively reactive, and their initial value treated consistently with subsequently set ones.

If you think that treating getter vs getter/setter properties differently is confusing, then you may want to revert #7302 instead so all values are made recursively reactive, irrespective of how the property is defined.  This may be easier for developers to understand but would break @DeyLak's use case.

Our typing is very complex. This pull request uses the new feature from TS 2.7 to combine record style and array style prop definition into one. https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/19227 
A simpler type definition should be beneficial to both our users and we maintainers. 

Kudos to @sandersn  @DanielRosenwasser !

Note: this requires TS 2.7+. So it is expected to be included in a minor version update.

Here's an initial implementation of Prettier integration, with changes made to each file so that we can see how the source would change. Once we've confirmed the configs in `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` look good, I think it would be a good idea to do the following prior to merging:

- Build the Prettier ESLint overrides into `eslint-plugin-vue-libs`.
- Ship the Prettier config with `eslint-plugin-vue-libs`, so that we can maintain consistency between projects with the following in a `.prettierrc.js` file:

  ```js
  module.exports = require('eslint-plugin-vue-libs/.prettierrc.js')
  ```

Then once this is merged, I can create PRs for our other repos.",2018-03-10 05:23:24+00:00,2018-10-22 19:39:12+00:00,,0,0,32,1587.0,5438.263333333333,0

Background: 
https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/676
https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/issues/627#issuecomment-357124941

TypeScript cannot give reasonable completion for `Vue.extend`. For example, `methods`, `data` will not appear in completion list.  This is caused by the intricate overloading resolution in compiler host. https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8005.

This problem will probably not fixed in foreseeable future. So we can work around this by placing normal component option before functional component. In most case, normal component option provides better completion. However, this will break type inference for functional component definition. 

By providing an additional argument in normal component's `render`, we can at least compile functional component. Unfortunately, this work around will skip checking `RenderContenxt`. IMHO Vue's type checking isn't primarily for checking but for completion and definition looking up. So I think this is a advantageous trade-off.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

**Other information:**

No longer manage style sheets and class list in vue and weex-js-runtime.

The key modifications are:

1. Add `@styleScope` attribute on each element which value equals the `scopeId`.
2. No longer parse styles from class list, just set `class` attribute directly.
3. Update related test cases.

**Other information:**

This PR adds a new function `Vue.prototype.$notify`, which works basically like `$emit`, except it returns an array that collects all return values of its event callbacks.

**Motivation:**

Developers of an component may want to collect data from callbacks of an event. There are a few options to do this:

1. Bind a function directly into the component. But it forces users of the component to write a function or needs the creator of the component writes property type checks to determine whether the prop value is callable or not.
2. Pass a callback parameter for the event. But nobody wants callbacks today.

To solve this issue, I'd like `$emit` or something else returns an array that collects all return values of its event callbacks. In order not to break old code, the behavior of `$emit` was kept ( which returns this ), but I wrote a new function instead. The function name `$notify` is not decided, but I can't come up with a better name.

7460,closed,fix(inject): hasOwn instead of 'in' (fix #7284),privatenumber,"The issue was caused by the [`in` operator check](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/inject.js#L55) to see if an injection exists in a parent provide.

In the particular Issue, the injection didn't work because the the Symbol polyfill adds a setter to the Object prototype for every Symbol created and the `in`-operator check evaluated to true on any object inheriting Object. [Demo](http://jsfiddle.net/hirokiosame/dronjdzm/23/)

However, I'm thinking the implications of using `in` may be further reaching as it could have been any native prototype property. [Here](http://jsfiddle.net/hirokiosame/dronjdzm/24/) I demonstrate using the string `'constructor'` leads to unexpected injection behavior.

Although this fixes #7284, I am framing this as a fix for prototype properties being injected.

Feel free to close this PR if it's not something we need to support (I've only done it because I've been reading through the issues, and this seemed like a quick one). I'm not sure if there's a better way than importing Vue, I couldn't find a way to resolve a globally registered component.

**Note**: Tests seem to pass, although I'm having a hard time running the weex specific tests locally.
Edit: tests do fail for weex, I can look into that if intending to merge, let me know.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [ ] Yes

**Other information:**

Fix bugs spotted in https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils/pull/317#discussion_r159149553.

Some type theory shenanigans below:

This pull request allows assigning `ComponentOption` of a Vue subclass to `Component`. The problem is that we used to mark default vm type  as `Vue` in `Component`. However, since `ComponentOption` is contravariant against vm type `V`. The default bound should not be the upper bound `Vue`, but the lower bound `never`.

For a more concrete example, consider this usage:

```ts
interface MyComponent extends Vue {
   num: number;
 }
 
const option: ComponentOptions<MyComponent> = {
  // a lifetime method
  created(this: MyComponent) { return this.num.toFixed() }
}
```

Then, assigning option to `ComponentOption<Vue>`, we could in theory do unsafe operation:

```ts
const anotherOption: ComponentOptions<Vue> = option

anotherOption.created.call(new Vue) // error! no property num on Vue!
```

Though it is not how we really use Vue, type checker cannot know this. To workaround, we can mark  `anotherOption` to have vm type as `never`.  `never` is the bottom type of any type, so `ComponentOption<never>`'s `create` method can accept nothing, and thusly any `create` method from subclass can satisfy _accepting nothing_ semantic. In practical words, this means we promise that we **never** use `created` like the way above.

- [x] Refactor

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

- [x] No

**Other information:**

### Remove legacy framework APIs

Remove the `init`, `reset`, `getRoot` and `receiveTasks` APIs, which are already implemented in the new version of `weex-js-runtime`.

Moreover, the deprecated timer APIs should also be removed when they were supported by native render engines (C++ timers).

### No longer execute the js code at front-end

Use `createInstanceContext` instead of `createInstance` to create the Vue module instance for each page. The Vue framework only needs to prepare the instance context and no longer execute the js code. The js code will be executed by native render engines.

### Flow type declarations

Add more reliable flow type declarations of Weex instance APIs and DOM APIs, and add type annotations for the entry file.

**Other information:**
The reason I'm submitting this PR is because for `nativescript-vue` we would like to introduce code-sharing between web and native, but one limiting factor is that we can't have more than 1 `template` or `script` tag in a SFC.

We would like to write our SFC like so:
```html
<template native>
    <StackLayout></StackLayout>
</template>
<template web>
    <div></div>
</template>

<style native>
    StackLayout { background: red; }
</style>
<style web>
    div { background: red; }
</style>

<script>
    export default {
        methods: {} // the core code
    }
</script>
<script native>
    export default {
        methods: {} // methods that interact with the UI.
    }
</script>
<script web>
    export default {
        methods: {} // methods that interact with the UI.
    }
</script>
```

7224,closed,fix(compiler): fix double escaping of ssrNode attribute values (fix #7223),felixbuenemann,"This fixes a double escaping of attribute values in the SSR optimizing
compiler, because literal attribute values get escaped early during the
call to `addAttr` inside `processAttrs` before it is known, if this
attribute will be serialized to an _ssrNode string template.

Later on the _ssrNode string template gets escaped again to preserve
whitespace and this causes double escaping of the whitespace inside the
attribute value.

This approach fixes the problem by undoing the escaping by parsing the
attribute value JSON in `genAttrSegment`, which is the easiest fix to
the problem, but probably not the best.

This fixes #7223 at least for the cases where I encountered the problem.

See #7223 for an in-depth description of the problem and a test-case.

**Other information:**

`Component` is too restrictive about `props` type: it either accepts an array or an object, but not both. This makes it illegal to assign `CompoenntOptions` to `Component`. Actually it is a typing bug, but it requires TS 2.6 to find this out. 

So this pull request also bumps the compiler version. It only affects development.
Bumping version also finds another method naming problem in directive test :)

It seems that @ktsn and I had the same problem at the same time, as I separately found and fixed the problem identified in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/7131 with this PR.  I noticed @HerringtonDarkholme had open questions about the `never` type.  My solution to the problem was a separate overload for `Vue.extend` and `Vue.component` that involves a third typed props type. I'm not expert enough on typescript to know which of these is a better solution, but I figured I'd open the duplicate-ish PR since I had a different approach in case you prefer it.",2017-11-27 07:39:06+00:00,2017-11-27 14:28:16+00:00,,0,0,66,1599.0,6.819444444444445,0

**Other information:**

Previously, if the user does not include `props` option in component options, `ThisType` has `Record<string, any>` in the members of intersection types. Then `this.notExistingProperty` is already passed if `props` options is missed.

```ts
export default Vue.extend({
  data() {
    this.notExistingProperty // <- this should be an error but currently isn't.
  }
})
```

I added a default type parameter of `Vue.component` and `Vue.extend` to avoid to allow any properties in `ThisType` when there is no `props` option.

I did not add a test for this because we need to check a compilation error to confirm that 😛 ",2017-11-26 14:07:46+00:00,2017-11-27 10:18:29+00:00,,0,0,66,1701.0,20.17861111111111,0

An out-in transition could get stuck if the child with v-if was not yet shown and then replaced with a different child. In this case, ""afterLeave"" would never get fired, thus ""_leaving"" stayed true indefinitely. This was likely to happen with vue-router and asynchronous data loading before the new page is shown.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**

- [x] No

**Other information:**

Compile the template twice with different options for weex platform if the `recyclable` flag is passed. Generate both normal render function and `@render` function for `<recycle-list>`.

Function names and arguments are also adjusted in `<recycle-list>` compiler.

If a component has the `recyclable` attribute on the template (`<template recyclable=""true"">`), weex-vue-loader will pass the `recyclable` option to weex-template-compiler. (https://github.com/weexteam/weex-vue-loader/commit/2b3ed319fa40bdde20f5a284399c1268a4af689d)

**Other information:**

Compile the `*.vue` file into js code, then run it in Weex context and compare the render result with the expected virtual dom tree.

It’s black-box testing for `weex-template-compiler`, `weex-vue-framework`, `weex-styler` and `weex-js-runtime`. The source code of the first two packages is in the current repo.

The test files are put in the `test/weex/cases`:

+ `render/`:  One-off render test cases.
  + `[name].vue`: Source code.
  + `[name].vdom.js`: Expected virtual dom tree.
+ `event/`:  Test cases which contain event bindings.
  + `[name].vue`: Source code.
  + `[name].before.vdom.js`: The first rendered virtual dom.
  + `[name].after.vdom.js`: The updated virtual dom after the event dispatch.

**Other information:**
Encountered an issue where v-model would not try to call a setter on an instance of a class.
A basic example:

```
    <div>
        <input v-model=""person.fullName"">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>First Name</td>
                <td>{{ person.firstName }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Last Name</td>
                <td>{{ person.lastName }}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Full Name</td>
                <td>{{ person.fullName }}</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
```
```
export class Person {
    constructor() {
        this.firstName = 'First'
        this.lastName = 'Last'
    }

    get fullName() {
        if (!this.lastName) {
            return this.firstName;
        }
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName
    }

    set fullName(v) {
        const split = v.split(' ', 2)
        this.firstName = split[0]
        this.lastName = split.length === 2 ? split[1] : ''
    }
}
```


In the above example the firstName and lastName don't change when the value of the input changes because the fullName setter is never called.

This PR fixes this by checking if we're trying to set a property that is defined as a setter in an object's prototype chain.
Because this explicitly checks for the presence of a .set on the property descriptor it will not try to set normal properties, to keep it more in line with how set has worked so far.

I'm guessing simply doing a (key in obj) check followed by a obj[key] = value would be more performant, but this being my first time looking at the Vue source code I'm not sure what this might break.",2017-10-26 20:17:40+00:00,2017-10-27 01:09:40+00:00,,0,0,30,2695.0,4.866666666666666,0

Did not make an issue for this, but would be nice to have this implemented.
To avoid warnings when integrating web components within Vue (e.g. polymer, ionic 4 / stenciljs), we currently need to add them to [ignoredElements](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#ignoredElements).
I think it would be a nice addition if we would be able to use a wildcard there, for example:

`Vue.config.ignoredElements = ['ion*']`

instead of 

`Vue.config.ignoredElements = ['ion-app', 'ion-header', 'ion-page', 'ion-toolbar', etc....]`


All tests pass: 
```
86 specs, 0 failures
Finished in 0.698 seconds

```
If there are better ways to implement this functionality (e.g. regex), let me know.

changes to the selection state since the ""input"" event will
always fire before the ""change"" event.

This avoids an issue where a user binds to the ""input"" event

model value back to the value of the select before it has
received the new selection value.

I've found it easier to debug my application if I use:

Vue.config.errorHandler = function(err, vm, info) {throw err};

Unfortunately, I found that my error handler wasn't being called if the error was encountered as a result of updating a reactive element.  Tracing back, I found that this was due to nextTick calling console.error directly instead of handleError.  I made this change locally and found that it fixed my problem, and didn't cause any failures with 'npm test'.

When mentioning certain library names like `vueify` and `vue-loader`, the documentation uses backticks in some places but not in others.  Of the cases I noticed, most were in links.  GitHub permits backticks within links and they are rendered with the fixed-width fontQ

The main README.md omits them for vue-loader.  To show the difference, I took the specific line from the table and included both forms:

From comment https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5415#issuecomment-327276515
"" in 2.4 we already shipped a pure js build of vue-server-renderer, but we haven't announced it yet. It only supports the base renderer, but is decoupled from Node.js APIs""

That statement is not correct. `basic.js` still use `process.nextTick()` when recursion stack is to high.
With this PR switching to iterative version we can avoid `process.nextTick()` path.
Ideally `createBasicRenderer` should use different `write` function but currently this PR is ""Request For Comments""

Also iterative version passes all SSR tests (not only basic if we switch to full server-renderer) and helps a lot for not Node.js env (in my case Nashorn)",2017-09-20 13:37:18+00:00,2017-10-03 21:57:10+00:00,,0,0,88,2022.0,320.3311111111111,0

**Other information:**

Sometimes I minified the code without `NODE_ENV=production`, It still warned me `You are running Vue in development mode.`, I don't think it's rigorous enough.

To determine whether the code runs in the development mode or in production mode, I think it should be judged from the behavior of the code, not just from the `NODE_ENV` flag when building.

So I add `function hasCrashed () {}`, when someone minified the code without flag. But the code here will know, ""Oh, You are No Longer Development!""

Also, I find the [doc](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/deployment.html) of VUE are still using the vue.js uncompressed version.

We are going to migrate to CircleCI 2.0 with #6041, but with a simpler description, we can make the build run time shorter.

When caching node_modules, the build is now finished in 1 minute 20 seconds.
https://circleci.com/workflow-run/7ea0d4e0-48ca-449d-9a52-9880dbbd93a5

In the case of 2.0, we have to describe all of the procedures procedurally, but on the contrary, I think that approach is easy to understand.

6620,closed,[weex] Adjust the weex platform entry file to fit the new weex runtime,Hanks10100,"> These changes will only affect the Weex platform, and will not affect any features on the web.

### Remove the `new Function` hack for V8

Remove the `callFunctionNative` method and the `compileBundle` API which is provided by modified V8.
In order to maintain the consistency of the js engine, Weex also uses JSC on Android. The legacy hack for V8 engine should be removed.

### Move shared APIs to Weex runtime

Modules and components should be registered in weex runtime, not in each front-end frameworks. The
`registerModules`, `registerComponents`, `weex.supports` and `weex.requireModule` APIs is moved to
Weex runtime which is in the https://github.com/apache/incubator-weex .

### Use `document` instead of `renderer`

Using `document` is more standard than using `renderer`. The `createElement` API support to create custom `WeexElement` now.

### Test cases

Weex's test cases have also been adjusted to fit the new `weex-js-runtime` architecture.",2017-09-16 04:40:49+00:00,2017-09-18 19:38:28+00:00,2017-09-18 19:38:28+00:00,1,0,70,978.0,62.96083333333333,1

  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
We have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]
You can also add a ""Donate"" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing ""required"" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

  Thank you for your great contribution to the open source community. You are awesome! 🙌
  And welcome to the open collective community! 😊

  Come chat with us in the #opensource channel on https://slack.opencollective.com - great place to ask questions and share best practices with other open source sustainers!

**Other information:**

When I debugged the source code, I found these positions that defined a method `hyphenate`, and the source code as follows:

```js
/**
 * Hyphenate a camelCase string.
 */
var hyphenateRE = /([^-])([A-Z])/g;
var hyphenate = cached(function (str) {
  return str
    .replace(hyphenateRE, '$1-$2')
    .replace(hyphenateRE, '$1-$2')
    .toLowerCase()
});
```
It will caused all the `6` output files

Just this method is used to change the `camelCase` to `camel-case`, So, If the second `replace` is not necessary. And take extra caused execution time.

**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?** (check one)

- [ ] Yes

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

While this introduces a slight behavior change, I believe the only scenario in which this would cause breakage is if an application has a non-reactive object inside of a non-reactive array and is relying on the reactivity system to detect changes to the elements in that array. This seems incredibly unlikely to happen as that use case has already gone to lengths to opt out of reactivity in the first place, so I expect this to be nothing but a performance improvement for those use cases if they exist.

6391,closed,Further improve Vue type declarations for canonical usage,HerringtonDarkholme,"This pull request supersedes #5887 .

Key improvements:
1.  More backward compatible via generic default
2. Props type inference

@ktsn @kaorun343 @DanielRosenwasser Your reviews or suggestions are welcome!

--------------

This section provides more background for other reviewers/readers.

Vue + TS users currently need helper library like vue-component-class to provide alternative API for TypeScript. Alternative API uses code pattern that TypeScript recognizes, but it splits Vue community.

Thankfully, TypeScript introduces [ThisType](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/14141) which can greatly improve Vue's canonical API. This PR introduces ThisType to Vue's official typing.

More importantly, this  improvement also benefits **JavaScript users**! VSCode users or Vue-language-server users exploits TypeScript compiler to provide editor services for JavaScript. Thus the typing improvement can help JavaScript completion more intelligent.

Goal:
1. Provide good enough completions for both JS users and new TS users (if they use canonical API).
2. Don't break existing TS libraries or projects. Or, make breaking minimal.

Non Goal:
1. This PR won't provide 100% typing precision or use case coverage. Such typing would be too prohibitive for both maintainers and users to reason.
2. Checking errors in JS isn't kept in mind. So changing existing JS to TS will cause errors.

Known limitations:
1. `new Vue()` wouldn't return a type with props type. This is caused by compiler limitations.
2. Props typing uses a hacky trick.
3. returning properties on this might trigger cyclic error, manual annotation is needed.
4. Prop type's union type declaration like `oneProp: [String, User]` might not work without manual annotation.

Next step:
Since we already has a canonical Vue API in TS, next we can ship tsx support in the official repo.",2017-08-17 12:09:30+00:00,2017-10-06 18:45:14+00:00,2017-10-06 18:45:14+00:00,1,0,57,1889.0,1206.5955555555556,1

In case of components that can work both as standalone and as children, it would be nice to be able to provide default values for the not provided dependencies.
It would also avoid the warning for missing inject in case this is one of the expected use case.

**Other information:**
CircleCI 2.0 allows for faster performance and reduced overall time to build and test by utilizing parallel testing via workflows. The codebase and dependencies are downloaded, cached, and are then used as part of a common workspace for the different components in `npm run test`, which have been split into four parallel containers.

Tests should complete in around 1m45s once the initial testing and caching has been done with CircleCI 2.0, compared to around 4m currently.

[size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) is a tool to show how many kilobytes your JS library increases the user bundle. You can set size budget and size-limit will prevent JavaScript libraries bloat on Travis CI.

It already used in Autoprefixer, PostCSS and JSS. For instance, I reduce Logux Client size 2x because I found some unexpected huge dependencies.

For Vue this tool can be useful to always know project size and prevent unexpected size regression.",2017-07-02 17:29:53+00:00,2017-07-04 06:46:20+00:00,,0,0,22,1535.0,37.274166666666666,0

**Other information:**

When binding a value using array or object syntax, it is much more human readable and human writable to allow white space within it. This PR makes a change to the 5th capture group of the HTML parser regex to not break the match when a white space appears, thus allowing you to have spaces in your array/object syntax.

For example, if you have a template like one of these:
```js
template: `<p :class=[color, decoration]>{{message}}</p>`,
//or
template: `<p :class={enabled: isEnabled, error: hasError}>{{message}}</p>`
```
The current parser will throw a template compilation error `- invalid expression: :class=""[color,""`. [Here is a simple jsfiddle showing the issue](https://jsfiddle.net/jimrottinger/50wL7mdz/40869/). The changes in this PR correctly grabs the entire array or object, white spaces included.",2017-06-17 11:00:35+00:00,2017-06-17 11:25:03+00:00,,0,0,66,2267.0,0.4077777777777778,0

5887,closed,Improve Vue type declarations for more canonical usage,DanielRosenwasser,"This PR improves the Vue `.d.ts` files so that users can get some improved inference when using the `noImplicitThis` compiler option. It takes advantage of many of the features the TypeScript team has been working on over the last few versions. Thus, it requires a minimum TypeScript version of 2.4. You can get this working with the current `typescript@next` (which is `2.5.0-dev.20170614`, but don't let that version number fool you - this will work with the final release of 2.4).

The best part about this change is that it makes using Vue easier when users choose not to use classes and inheritance. In other words, users and can more easily `new` up an instance using the Vue constructor, and can create components using the `Vue.extend` and `Vue.component` APIs a little more naturally. Extending Vue as a class will still work, so if you prefer to use vue-class-component and the rest, that should still work! However, those dependencies may need to be updated for this change.

There's definitely some amount of complexity that's been introduced but I'm willing to iterate on this with the help of others. Given the feedback that we've heard on [TypeScript-Vue-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter), it's been a positive experience for users.

Fixes many of the issues users have asked about in #478.

Tests are probably failing at this point because I need to update the project's dependency on TypeScript.",2017-06-14 23:07:28+00:00,2017-08-29 14:36:49+00:00,,0,0,54,1448.0,1815.4891666666667,0

Sorry for not following the ""Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it."" rule, no loss on my side if you don't want to accept this.

I would like this feature as it will allow Vue to call a user provided callback for `warn`ings which helps for asserting the state of warnings during testing or development, without having to either spyon or monkeypatch the `console.error` function.

**Other information:**

This PR moves the link to the documentation site under it's own heading in the repo's README.

The reason I submitted this PR is that I often have trouble finding the Vue docs.
When googling I click the Vue github repo link by default. 
When landing on the github repo I am confused as to where the docs are.
Currently there **is** a link to the documentation site, however it is not very noticeable.
In order to make it **more** noticeable and easier for other developers to find, I have moved the link to the documentation under it's own heading.

This will make it easier for developers to quickly find a link to the Vue documentation from the github repo.

5709,closed,Add handleError during event handling,chrisnicola,"Currently handleError is used to handle errors during lifecycle hooks and component rendering. This handles most errors thrown by the component however event handlers are not handled. So a component like:

```
<template>
  <button @click=""error()"">I Throw Errors</button>
</template>

<script>
  {
    methods: {
      error() { throw new Error('thrown!'); }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Will simple throw an error and the error will never be passed to `handleError` nor is one able to use `Vue.config.errorHandler` for error reporting. For my specific use case I wanted to make sure that the plugin I use to report errors to Honeybadger would catch and report errors in event handlers, but more generally any error reporting that relies on `errorHandler` will require this.

It makes sense to me that, for consistency, Vue would want to handle errors in event handlers the same way as is done lifecycle hooks and rendering. This is consistent with the changes requested and completed in #5198 and #4370.

As this is my first PR, I hope these changes are up to the code standard for the project, but if there is anything else needed just let me know and I'll fix it.

If yes, please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications:

While it is unlikely any running apps would have depended on this behaviour. This introduces a change which will result in exceptions thrown by event handlers to be handled by `handleError` and any function assigned to `Vue.config.errorHandler`. Since errors are not re-thrown by `handleError` any code that was depending on errors in events not being handled could theoretically break. I thought it would be worthwhile to note this.

Here is a part of the template which will be rendered both in client-side and server-side:
```
<div v-for=""i in 3"" v-if=""0===i"" :is=""tabs[i].type"" v-bind=""tabs[i].data""></div>
```
In Vue 2.3.0, it was rendered to two VNodes: `[component, text]`, while the server-side only rendered the first node. 

The case will lead to this error: `The client-side rendered virtual DOM tree is not matching server-rendered content.`

The problem is, by method `normalizeArrayChildren`, `[component, comment, comment]` will be processed into ` [component] -> [component, comment] ->  [component, text]`.

When exploring [css-in-js solutions](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) for vue, I came across the fact that some auto prefixed style objects (for example, by [postcss-js](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-js)) cannot be directly used as `style` option on elements, when they have an array as value, e.g.
```
{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-webkit-flex', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }
```
...which happens when a rule value needs to be prefixed, other examples:
```
{ backgroundImage: ['radial-gradient(...)', '-webkit-radial-gradient(...)']
{ cursor: ['-webkit-grab','grab'] }
```
This PR adds support for directly consuming such objects as `style` option.        ",2017-04-17 06:16:22+00:00,2017-04-17 12:49:10+00:00,2017-04-17 12:49:10+00:00,0,0,55,1982.0,6.546666666666667,1

SSR `v-show` directive should be merged from parent to child component.

It could be reproduced via this [github repo](https://github.com/defcc/v-show-ssr-bug/). 

And the demo code is bellow:

```js
var Vue = require('vue/dist/vue.common.js')
var createRenderer = require('vue-server-renderer').createRenderer
var renderToString = createRenderer().renderToString

const vm = new Vue({
  template: `
    <foo v-show=""false""></foo>
  `,
  components: {
    foo: {
      render: h => h('bar'),
      components: {
        bar: {
          render: h => h('div', 'inner')
        }
      }
    }

  }
})

renderToString(vm, (err, res) => {
  console.log(res)
})
```

The result is `<div server-rendered=""true"">inner</div>`, it should be `<div server-rendered=""true"" style=""display:none;"">inner</div>`

Hi,

Please see #5145 

This patch adds a warning when user is not passing props in kebab-case mistakenly, for example:

```html
<foo someProp=""bar""></foo>
should be
<foo some-prop=""bar""></foo>
```

I know this is stated on the guide, but since it's a very common mistake (based on the questions on stackoverflow (see the issue above) [and the](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/unable-to-pass-data-from-parent-to-child-component/1763/1) [forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/t/need-help-with-passing-a-boolean-prop-to-a-comonent/3996/1 )), I think it is worth to add a warning and I believe this will save a lot of people's debugging time and provide a more friendly development experience.

And for the performance, this is not a complex algorithm. It only adds a fews operations (both `toLowerCase` and `hasOwnProperty` are fast enough) in O(n) so I would say the impact on performance is negligible (almost no impact when running unit test on my machine). 

thanks!",2017-03-10 04:12:45+00:00,2017-03-13 07:41:27+00:00,2017-03-13 07:41:27+00:00,0,0,41,1259.0,75.47833333333334,1

**Other information**:
In #5029 I outlined how the bootstrap library that is used in the dbmon benchmark references font files that are not included in the repo.
Rather than including them in the repo I thought a better approach would be to customize the bootstrap library to only include exactly what the benchmark actually needed.

The customization options are stored, by bootstrap, in the minified file. For quick reference you can find it [here.](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=7bd1d75ceeb95d343d9e16d305e782cd)

Size of the library goes from 102KB to 49KB.

This resolves my original problem as the ""Glyphicons"" module of bootstrap is no longer included and the references to fonts have been removed from the library.

#### Update based on comments:
This PR now removes the bootstrap library that the js-repaint-perfs library was using in favour of using the `styles.css` that the library now uses.",2017-03-07 20:16:49+00:00,2017-03-09 01:23:21+00:00,2017-03-09 01:23:20+00:00,0,0,50,1233.0,29.108888888888888,1

I feel these definition files don't give good development experimence to users, to say the least.
As well as typescript, I hope to provide the official flowtype definitions.

I'm considering the below specs:
- Adding `decls` directory for flowtype definition
- Put type definitions in the same [directory structure](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/npm) as flow-typed
- Testing type definitions with `flow-bin` (already installed with package.json)

5016,closed,refactor TypeScript typings to use ES style exports,yyx990803,"This PR will change Vue's TS typings to use ES-style exports so that it works better with the new ES module build + webpack 2 combo.

So instead of:

``` js
import Vue = require('vue')
```

TS users should now use:

``` js
import Vue from 'vue'
```

...which is consistent with recommended plain ES usage.

This is technically a breaking change, but since we've already unintentionally caused a breaking change for webpack 2 + TS users, we should probably just fully migrate to ES-based exports to avoid more breakage in the future.

4994,closed,Add support for array as inline style value (client/ssr),fnlctrl,"When exploring [css-in-js solutions](https://github.com/MicheleBertoli/css-in-js) for vue, I came across the fact that some auto prefixed style objects (for example, by [postcss-js](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-js)) cannot be directly used as `style` option on elements, when they have an array as value, e.g.
```
{ display: ['-webkit-box', '-webkit-flex', '-ms-flexbox', 'flex'] }
```
...which happens when a rule value needs to be prefixed, other examples:
```
{ backgroundImage: ['radial-gradient(...)', '-webkit-radial-gradient(...)']
{ cursor: ['-webkit-grab','grab'] }
```
This PR adds support for directly consuming such objects as `style` option.        
         
     
      


This is really an edge case (inline style option + style object with value as an array), so I totally understand if this is not going into the core.

4975,closed,Adding the ability to suppress notifications in Vue.set and Vue.delete,sffc,"Currently, whenever you call `Vue.set` or `Vue.delete`, all observers on the object being modified are executed.  This is a ""safe"" practice, because it ensures that any objects who had previously attempted to access the key being added or deleted get their dependencies re-computed.

However, consider the case where you have an object with many different keys and watchers, which might be expensive to call.  In this case, `Vue.set` will do a lot of work executing all of the watchers, even if none of them respond to the new field in the object, causing poor performance.

Here is a fiddle to demonstrate the issue: https://jsfiddle.net/exe3nxzg/2/ .  Adding new keys to the object causes the watcher on the original field to be triggered, even though that watcher doesn't care about the values of the new keys.

This PR offers a possible fix to the problem, which is to add an options object as the final argument of `Vue.set` and `Vue.delete`.  If the user wishes to manually suppress notifications on the object and prevent all watchers from being computed, they can pass `{ notify: false }` as the final argument.

Another possible fix would be to add a new function called `Vue.get`.  If `Vue.set` replaces the syntax `obj[key]=value` and `Vue.delete` replaces the syntax `delete obj[key]`, then `Vue.get` would replace the syntax `obj[key] || default`.  More precisely, a definition could look something like:

```js
Vue.get = function(obj, key, defaultValue) {
	if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
		// create the key on the object with the default value.
		// call defineReactive(), etc.
		// however, do NOT call notify on the object.
	}
	return obj[key];
};
```

This way, whenever a key access is attempted, a reactive is left behind, such that setting the property in the future, even via `Vue.set`, will not cause a full notify.

From the discussions here:

and here:

https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/aa6f7b4cdb889fba9575710c5a100234ccfb7975

and because it also annoys me, I decided to try and set up a flag, which will allow a dev to ""consciously"" remove the production tips info. 

It is also related to (requires) this PR for the webpack template.

https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack/pull/510

The flag is currently set to ""false"", so the client dev will have to go into the file and set it to true, to remove the production tips info. 

If you let me know how to best document the availability of the flag (if the two PRs get accepted), I'd be also glad to add into about the flag to the docs too. 

Also, this currently only works for the webpack setup. I haven't looked into the other build possibilities.

This pr tries to alleviate the problem in https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4872. When users include third party library into server bundle, the parsing overhead can be smaller.

If user provided global variable is compared with another global variable in library code, they will never be equal because they are executed in different context.

To fix this generally, we have to run library code and user code in the same context. This means we need to parse a lot of code in one request. 

We can skip parsing by creating a `Script` object, and `runInNewContext` is [effectively a shortcut](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5de3cf099cd01c84d1809dab90c041b76aa58d8e/lib/vm.js#L62-L65). Thus it is safe to reuse the `Script` object.

Reusing `Script` should save several C++ call and reduce garbage collection pressure since the underlying C++ object has a [`Persistent`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5de3cf099cd01c84d1809dab90c041b76aa58d8e/src/node_contextify.cc#L461) which will not be collected until [out of memory](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/5080) (it is cargo cult to me, though).

However, I **cannot see a performance improvement** in a simple benchmark,  regardless of whether bundling library code into server entry. (I use vue-hackernews as example, tested under `ab -n 1000 -c 100`).
It seems v8 will [cache compiled code](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/30224360c10ddd065f46eb81fffa69b88e5378d2/src/compiler.cc#L1571-L1573). So parsing overhead is relatively ignorable in real world.

4745,closed,[weex] Fix the memory crosstalk between multiple instance,Hanks10100,"In Weex, all instance share a same runtime, the closure of `Dep`, `Scheduler` and so on, are also shared by multiple instance.

If the previous instance was crashed by accident, some shared variables might still remain the old value when creating the new instance.

## Modification

In particular, the following variables have the protential risk of memory crosstalk:

+ [`core/observer/dep.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/994aee4f869d68a00c3b9d87daa9c8d84623ac42/src/core/observer/dep.js#L48-L49)

  + `targetStack`
+ [`core/observer/scheduler.js`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/994aee4f869d68a00c3b9d87daa9c8d84623ac42/src/core/observer/scheduler.js#L12-L16)
  + `queue`
  + `has`
  + `circular`
  + `waiting`
  + `flushing`

The modification is simple: Just reset those variables to its initial value before `createInstance` and `destroyInstance`. (*Actually, reset the value in `createInstance` is enough, but do likewise in `destroyInstance` is more reliable*)

## Example

Here is an example:

```html

4731,closed,add types for Vue 1.x,kaorun343,"Hi.

This is a PR to add TypeScript definition files for Vue.js 1.x into this repository.
Since Vue decided to bundle its definition files, they were hosted on DefinitelyTyped.

* https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/13230
* https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/13235
* https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/13236

However, as these PRs imply, `vue.d.ts` was removed and currently there's no way to manage the 1.x's one.
In addition, there were a lot of changes between 2.x's and 1.x's definition, such as `vuejs` namespace, plural or singular. So I changed its content in order to allow users to use what version they like with TypeScript.
Of course, the past definitions were written for TS 1.x, but this one is for TS 2.x.

* `DirectiveOption(s)` is going to be generic interface
* `Directive` -> `DirectiveInstance<V extends Vue>`

4652,closed,Necessary changes to observer for full Tracker compatibility,mitar,"(This is all open for debate and I understand that it is previously undiscussed pull request, but it is easier to debate it with concrete code changes available.)

I am working on integration of Vue with [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor) and I would like that Vue could be a drop-in replacement for Blaze. That is almost possible, because architecture is very similar. Vue is also using reactive dependency tracking, observer, while Meteor/Blaze is using [Tracker](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/tracker). Now, there is a lot of code written for Meteor which is using Tracker and it would be great if it could just work with Vue. And in fact it is doable. I managed to create a [full 100% compatible Tracker implementation on top of Vue's observer](https://github.com/mitar/vue-test/blob/master/packages/tracker/tracker.js). But there are some changes necessary to observer's implementation and some internals have to be exposed.

This pull request is initial version of changes I had to do to get this first version of Tracker implemented, to get discussion rolling. I would really like to see if this or something like this could get merged into Vue. From my perspective changes do not really change how observer is working, and all existing tests are still passing.

A list of changes:

* added support for after flush callbacks
* adding a way to force flushing
* fixed exception recovery for pushTarget/popTarget
* correctly cleanup queue if there is an exception from getter
* exposing some internals (probably too much, API could be cleaner there)

Requesting comments, feedback, suggestions. This is work in progress. I will add tests in the future, after we finalize that this is OK to do and everything else.

As for **isSpecialTag** logic, the original implementation checks the tagName and its attribute. If it's a **template** with **lang attribute**, it will skip to parse the content inside the template. I think maybe we could simplify it, because the template element is guaranteed by the SFC parser.

you mentioned that you have plans to improve the test story.

We want to propose TestCafe as an official testing tool for the Vue ecosistem.
Our e2e testing framework is a pure node.js solution, so it can easily integrate with Vue.

In this pull request, I rewrote all e2e tests using TestCafe to demonstrate key features, such as:

-  clean code (no 'waitForElementVisible', no waiting for page loads and xhr requests)
-  no need for additional dependencies, configs and browser plugins
-  easy setup
-  ES2016 syntax
-  flexible selectors

We would be happy to cooperate with you and we are ready to create vue-specific features (similar to Protractor selectors for Angular).

What do you think about it?

Which prints out all the line number of potential unsound `any` type. Only files under `src/compiler/codegen/` are checked.

To my consternation, we have a lot of `implictAny` in code base, (and I have no idea why). Fixing these `any` needs some weird typing and dependency on how flow works (in my conjecture).

4506,closed,Support async component hydration in SSR,HerringtonDarkholme,"Fix #4387. Improve async component SSR performance by reducing bailing.

The basic idea here is, skip checking async component when hydration. To support this, I introduced a new flag on VNode `isAsyncPlaceholder`. A placeholder VNode is same as an emptyVNode, except the new flag set to true. Before this commit, an async component will be rendered to emptyVNode(in `createElement`). After this commit, an async component will be rendered to placeholderVNode. So the behavior in client-side rendering or bailed SSR rendering should be kept.

In SSR hydration, we skip checking a placeholder VNode against a real element. After component is resolved, the Vue instance in question will `$forceUpdate` in callback. So even if the real element dismatches with resolved VNode, rendered dom structure should be up to date. 

**Current implementation cannot reuse dom for async component because `isHydrating` is not available in `createComponent`.**

Another potential problem is that third party code can attach event handler / store data on SSR element. Those information will be lost in `$forceUpdate` callback. But I would suggest library users should care about it because I wonder if a library can provide a silver-bullet strategy.",2016-12-17 11:52:26+00:00,2017-02-16 07:23:34+00:00,,0,0,40,1240.0,1459.5188888888888,0

`vm.$el` should always be the same as `vm.$vnode.elm`

More detail:

1. If a component changes its root element during rendering, all ancestors' placeholder root element's element should be all updated.

2. If one component is the root element of another component, for example `wrapper` in the test case, and wrapper's parent is updated (which triggers wrapper's `updateFromParent`), `wrapper`'s $vnode is not the same as `comp`'s $vnode.parent. While in the initial rendering, these two vnodes are the same one.

To simplify these two statements, we have to keep one invariant: `vm.$el` should always be the same as `vm.$vnode.elm`. Otherwise vdom patching will mistakenly insert new dom node.

If we correctly sync vnode's element when child tree's root changes its tag (1), and update vm's vnode when parent is updated(2), we can ensure $el is up to date.

This allow to use other block appart from `template`, `script` or

4007,closed,SSR: eliminate closure in render.js implementation,HerringtonDarkholme,"I'm trying to remove closures in src/server/render.js.

Removing closures can improve runtime performance, enable easier reasoning about memory leakage, and prevent erroneous captured variable reused.  

The basic idea is to pack all captured variable into a `RenderContext` structure. In closure based implementation, all state changes are implicitly stored by wrapping `next` function. In context based implementation state transitions are explicitly recorded in `renderStates` property. 

I have ran a preliminary benchmark [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yxUXYqelR7VcyFHXXVBvZY9iBIr422I6uO8K2P8aU0M/edit#gid=0) by running `npn run bench:ssr`.
It seems closure elimination can achieve 20% performance boost.
#4002 has also been fixed in this, because contexts are separated between two render function.

3943,closed,fix root v-else not rendering in prod and switched examples to minified vue for better prod coverage,chrisvfritz,"Fixes #3940. This was a bit of a brainless error on my part - I apologize. Something I noticed however, is that none of our tests are currently covering the production build of Vue, thus allowing this error to slip through. To prevent this in the future, I was wondering if we should split the unit tests into two groups:
- Development-specific behavior (e.g. warnings)
- Features that should behave the same in both dev and prod, which will perform a second run with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`

I think that work would be well outside the scope of this PR, but as a stop-gap measure to cover production at least a little, I switched all of the e2e examples to use the production build, then tweaked the grid example so that I could add a regression test. 

My thinking is that production is probably most important for e2e anyway, as devs will more quickly discover development-only errors (and they won't affect end users). The only downside I can foresee is that if someone clones the repo to start playing with examples, they won't get any nice warnings if they make a mistake. So, I added a comment above each Vue script with instructions to use the development version if they'd like. Still, I'm happy to change it back if this is undesirable. We'd just have to think of another way to add a regression test.

One last unrelated note: while updating the examples, I noticed that the todomvc's HTML file was full of tabs rather than spaces, so I converted them for consistency.

3710,closed,Allow for function as child,blocka,"Function as a child is a very powerful pattern employed in react.  It allows the consumer of a component to choose how to render a component, while having access to data passed down by the parent.

It is similar to slots, in a way, except slots only gain you access to the data in the hosting component.

For more information on the possibilities that this pattern enables, please see [this blog post](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9), [this presentation from Ryan Florence at React Rally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp-NOggyz54), as well as the new API for [React Router 4.0](https://react-router.now.sh/).

Before I go on, I do want to say that the pattern is achievable right now using props:

It is possible now to mimic this using props with the following pattern:

```
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    props: ['render'],
    render (h) {
       return this.render('Hello, World');
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData render={data => <span>{data}</span>}></ComponentWithData>
    }
})
```

However, ""first-class"" support would be nice.

As far as the vue flavor, the API looks like this:

```
const ComponentWithInfo = {
    render (h) {
       return this.$slots.default('Hello, World')
    }
}

new Vue({
    render (h) {
         return <ComponentWithData>{data => <span>{data}</span>}</ComponentWithData>
    }
})
```

A couple of things:

1) In my implementation, if an array is passed for children, and any of the children are a function, that will throw away all children, except for the function
2) I understand that there is an API freeze, but this is not breaking any existing APIs, only adding on.
3) Please feel free to reject this specific PR, although if you do, I think this is worthwhile feature to consider.

```
Set now requires you to specify the object you are modifying as the first argument. See: http://rc.vuejs.org/api/#Vue-set

I hope that this PR will be merged and modified the files to achieve these things by other people.
- [x] Adding rest definitions since v1.0 such as lifecycle hooks.
- [x] Adding the functions related to `createElement` and writing the interface `VNode` and others.
- [x] Considering the naming of the interfaces, for instance, whether we should use the same name between TS and Flow.
- Adding JSDoc/TSDoc comments for IDE. If allowed, I'd like to refer to the official documents.
- [x] Adding a test if needed as well as we did in DefinitelyTyped
- Modifying `vue-class-component` to use this new definition file when this is finished

The problem appears to be rooted in [`prevTarget`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/observer/watcher.js#L15) getting funky [during instance mounting](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/instance/lifecycle.js#L53). This causes `Dep.target` to never be reset to `null`.

This is most likely not the best solution. Maybe a better place for solution would be around [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/instance/lifecycle.js#L54) or [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.0.0-alpha.5/src/core/observer/watcher.js#L77).

Also I can't come up with a better unit test than the original repro:
- Create two instances, first with a computed property (easiest way to reproduce), make sure computed field is used in the template,
- Change the data of the second instance,
- Make sure that first instance didn't update.

Should I include it anyway?

### Steps to reproduce

IOS 9.3.x系统的以下浏览器中打开demo页面：
- QQ浏览器
- QQ Webview
- 支付宝webview
- 微博webview
- UC浏览器
- Opera
- 百度浏览器：

执行以下动作：
- 1.在灰色区域内随意高频大幅度滑动（让滚动条有滚动）；
- 2.点击左上角的按钮
### What is Expected? What is actually happening?

点击按钮后，弹出“Right”的是Vue正常工作，弹出“Error”是Vue出现了异常。

我用v-text方法在按钮上输出arr.length。同时我在这里的click事件中用原生方法做了一个强制判断：

``` javascript
this.arr.length == document.getElementById(""button"").textContent
```

而在IOS 9.3.x的这些出现异常的浏览器中这时候arr.length的真实数值和按钮上显示的不一样，所以会弹“Error”。

目前已知在IOS 9.3.x以下浏览器中运行是正常的：
- 360浏览器
- firefox
- safari
- chrome
- 微信webview

在IOS9.2及以下的系统版本中所有浏览器都是正常的。

通过审查Vue的源码，发现问题出在util/env.js中全局MutationObserver的监听。

``` javascript
  /* istanbul ignore if */
  if (typeof MutationObserver !== 'undefined' && !(isWechat && isIos)) {
    var counter = 1
    var observer = new MutationObserver(nextTickHandler)
    var textNode = document.createTextNode(counter)
    observer.observe(textNode, {
      characterData: true
    })
    timerFunc = function () {
      counter = (counter + 1) % 2
      textNode.data = counter
    }
  } else {
    // webpack attempts to inject a shim for setImmediate
    // if it is used as a global, so we have to work around that to
    // avoid bundling unnecessary code.
    const context = inBrowser
      ? window
      : typeof global !== 'undefined' ? global : {}
    timerFunc = context.setImmediate || setTimeout
  }
```

v1.0.24里这段不计入代码覆盖率测试的代码中，还特意对IOS的微信webview做了强制降级处理（函数的异步执行不使用MutationObserver而采用setTimeout(0)），所以在微信webview下没有这个异常。尝试取消对IOS的微信的特殊处理后，微信webview也出现了这个问题。

经过实验测试基本可以认为是浏览器底层对MutationObserver的异步执行出现了问题，在浏览器屏幕滚动或回弹的过程中如果同时让touch的一些默认事件触发，会产生对MutationObserver的阻塞，以至于MutationObserver的回调函数不去执行。造成后后面一系列的异常。

IOS 9.3对系统底层的touch、click等很多事件进行了重写，取消了300ms延迟可能会连带着在一些莫名其妙的地方带来阻塞，特别容易对一些涉及异步的原生方法产生影响。

有异常的国产浏览器的共同点是他们都是UIWebView，表现正常的浏览器（safari除外）均采用了WKWebView。

（补充：在IOS中，WKWebView是IOS8以后才有的，比UIWebView更新，性能也更好，现在还没推广开来，国内厂商大都还在用UIWebView。）

我最后提交了一个PR，改成对IOS 9.3的所有UIWebView在MutationObserver这个方法上做降级处理。（UIWebView不支持IndexedDB）

把源码中对ios微信的hack删掉了，毕竟实在太dirty……不过PR里面我对IOS9.3的判断这里我处理得也很dirty，这个与系统的UIwebview相关的bug估计以后不一定会修复，用系统版本来做判断毕竟不是长久之计。这个issue的异常就需要尤大大进一步考虑了。

如果不改Vue的源码，在这里对touch事件全部preventDefault掉，所有默认的触屏事件都用其他库来实现也是解决方法之一。但是我们的业务不允许我们preventDefault掉所有touchmove，所以只有在Vue源码中找原因了。

2950,closed,Add halt event modifier.,knpwrs,"In my experience with JavaScript it is _very_ common to call `stopPropagation` and `preventDefault` in tandem. This pull request adds a modifier which is a shortcut for both. Just a few notes:

1.) I am not attached to the name `halt`.
2.) If this looks good I can go ahead and add docs.

Possible alternative implementation:

``` js
    if (this.modifiers.stop || this.modifiers.halt) {
      handler = stopFilter(handler)
    }
    if (this.modifiers.prevent || this.modifiers.halt) {
      handler = preventFilter(handler)
    }
```

Or, since `this.modifiers` is called a whole bunch:

``` js
    var mods = this.modifiers
    if (mods.stop || mods.halt) {
      handler = stopFilter(handler)
    }
    if (mods.prevent || mods.halt) {

But in some other virtual dom situation like mobile web or native app, the first time rendering is not as fast as users' expectation. So I tried to make ""a little"" change to implement ""stream rendering"" to optimize the first-screen perf. And let it be able to append the whole dom tree either once or node-by-node:
1. changed `__h__(tag, data, children)` into `__r__(__s__(tag, data), children)` so the parent node could be calculate->generate->append first and the children later.
2. supported `stream: true` option and added a new `__stream_patch__` method besides `__patch__` to optimize the first-time rendering logic. If no `stream: true` option set, just render as normal before.
3. supported `atom: true` in `vnode.data` to describe whether this node will be appended with its children together as a atom or child-by-child in ""stream rendering"" mode.

Additionally, I changed the `class`/`staticClass` from string to array and added an object `staticStyle` for better virtual dom control.

Currently the ""currency"" filter only accepts one argument: the currency symbol. The number of decimal places is fixed as 2. This can cause troubles with several currencies out there whose number of decimal places can be 0 (e.g. Japanese Yen or Vietnamese Dong) or 3 (e.g. Jordanian Dinar).

This commit modifies the filter to accept an extra optional argument: decimal places, which defaults to 2. With this, one can write `{{ 1234 | currency '¥' 0 }}` to properly display a Yen value. Backward compatibility is maintained.

(Just realized there's a [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35725935/need-a-flexible-currency-filter-in-vuejs) about this very issue, where the OP was recommended to create a new filter, which is anti-DRY IMO).

**This bug fixes #2666, a html file reproducing the bug within it's context can be found [here](https://github.com/GuillaumeLeclerc/vue-seo/blob/master/examples/hreflang.html)** 

Since it's only one line I don't think a test is required but I'll explain why the bug occurs and why the PR fixes this.

As stated [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/be7339b38ad5083fd0d0baaa2eb9f508b5f9ce23/src/directives/internal/component.js#L55), the compilation is cached so for all components except the first one the attributes are not removed. Users might want to use the ':is' version. In this case it's not removed from the DOM and visible.

This PR fixes the bug in my codebase.

Thank you !

Note: this uses no dirty checking and instead uses ES6 proxies, which is supported only on latest chrome and firefox.

- Pull my branch `reactive-warn` into your repo.
- edit `changewatch/index.html` with updates

2211,closed,"Support backspace with ""delete"" keycode alias",thecrypticace,"Currently when using the `delete` alias in a on directive with keyup `delete"" does not support using backspace. This seems quite counterintuitive. Additionally, on Mac keyboards the key normally identified as ""backspace"" on PC keyboards is called ""delete."" I was fairly surprised when using the delete modifier didn't detect the key.

I came upon this when developing a search / tag field that turned a search query into tokens when hitting enter or space. I wanted a way to delete tokens without using the mouse. The solution I came up with was detecting the delete key and removing the last token if the search field was empty. I spent 10 minutes debugging code until I realized that I had to press fn+delete (equivalent of DEL / forward delete on a Mac laptop-sized keyboard) for it to actually remove the token.

You can see a reduced test case / demo of this here: http://codepen.io/thecrypticace/pen/YwGKmJ

This PR makes a change to allow aliases to map to multiple key codes. And, using that, it adds support for delete to react to both backspace and DEL / forward delete.

这个是我上次提的[Issuess](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/2036)，非常感谢您的回答。

晚上发现在1.0x版本中$watch存在一个问题，您的batcher中存在两个队列，一个是用户注册的Wather的队列，一个是内部代码注册的Watcher。在将watcher推入队列的时候，用watcher.user判断应该推入哪个队列。

我想起在0.11版本中vm的$watch方法中，实例化Watcher的时候是设置了user为true的。

而在新的1.0x版本中，为什么$watch代码里初始化Watcher的时候却没有设置user。

下面是两个版本的对比:

``` Javascript
  // 摘至1.0x版本的$watch方法：
  var watcher = new Watcher(vm, expOrFn, cb, {
    deep: options && options.deep,
    sync: options && options.sync,
    filters: parsed && parsed.filters
  })

```

``` Javascript
  //摘至0.11版本的$watch方法：
  watcher = vm._userWatchers[key] =
    new Watcher(vm, exp, wrappedCb, {
      deep: deep,
      user: true
  })

```

This pull request provides an alternate implementation of `Function` based on node.js `vm` module when the native `Function` doesn't work. These changes make _Vue_ work fine on Atom (and similar node.js based environment that may have forbidden `new Function()`)

I ran browserify and webpack over the modified project, so far it doesn't break.

EDIT: I saw the csp-compliant build, which works on Atom as well, but when available, the `vm` based implementation may be more efficient than `notevil.Function`.

在events里面最近我的项目遇到了一个小坑，大概是这个样一个结构:

``` javascript
// child1 events
events: {
    'confirm-ok' () {
        let {
            olaplink, isOperate
        } = this.needToDelete;
        if (!olaplink.value && isOperate) {
            this.$dispatch('refreshComponent', this.componentId);
            this.olaplinkSettings.operationColumn.$remove(olaplink);
        }

    }
}

// child2 events
events: {
    'refreshComponent' () {
        // something       
    }
}

// parent events
events: {
    'refreshComponent'(...args) {
        this.$broadcast('refreshComponent', ...args);
    },
    'confirm-ok'() {
        // something
    }
}
```

目前表现现状是当child1的`confirm-ok`事件触发时，parent的`confirm-ok`事件也被同步触发（这里的代码按照官网说明理应不被触发才对）

在这样一个需要父级中转的事件中，在child1被触发`confirm-ok`时，需要先触发`refreshComponent`事件，通过父级中转会之后，因为之前在`events.js`中98行得到是否继续向上触发的结果之前，本身又被父级转发的`refreshComponet`事件导致自身`_shouldPropagate`为true(`events.js`第91行).
事件`refreshComponent`触发完毕后，执行到`events.js`99行时，此时的`_shouldPropagate`结果本应该是fase，但是由于上一次事件传递的影响这里的`_shouldPropagate`并不是正确的值。

故我认为应该在这里增加一下对`_shouldPropagate`的重新赋值以得到正确的结果

谢谢

Previously objects with properties with get/set defined outside of vue wouldn't propagate value changes after being made reactive in vue. This uses getOwnPropertyDescriptor to detect that case and account for it. 

Since it seems like every browser with supports defineProperty also supports getOwnPropertyDescriptor, I didn't add any logic to detect/work without it. 

Also added are two test cases testing the concept. 

If this addition gets pulled, it'd also probably be worthwhile checking the 'configurable' property. If configurable is set to false, defineReactive currently just throws an error. I imagine the correct behavior would be just to return out without changing anything; but this patch doesn't address it.

1285,closed,Add mixed type properties.,nkovacs,"Literal property auto-casting now respects property type(s),
and will not cast a property to boolean or number if it
cannot be a boolean or number.

Fixes #1284, #1148 

There were a few special cases that are a bit different for mixed types, but it should be backwards compatible:
- `default` will always be called even if one of the types is `Function`. But if the only type is `Function`, it won't be called, like before. In practice it probably doesn't makes sense to have a property that can be either a Function or something else.
- If the default is not specified and the property is omitted, the default is undefined, except for Boolean, where it is false. For a mixed type, the default will be undefined even if one of the possible types is Boolean. It might make sense to use false as the default here, but in practice both are falsy, and you can specify a default, so it's not a big issue.
- In contrast to the previous point, if one of the possible types is Boolean (explicitly specified), and the attribute value is omitted (or is an empty string), it will be cast to true, even if String is also an accepted type for the property. This is how it worked previously for Boolean type properties, so I extended that to mixed properties that include Boolean. It made more sense for a property without a value to be true in this case, instead of a falsy empty string.

For example:

```
prop1: [Boolean, String]
prop2: String

<example></example> <!-- undefined undefined -->
<example prop1 prop2></example> <!-- true, '' -->
<example prop1=""foo"" prop2=""foo""></example> <!-- 'foo' 'foo' -->
<example prop1=""123"" prop2=""123""></example> <!-- '123' '123' -->

Added the ability to specify an expression, via attribute `exp`, which will be evaluated on the current scope and set as the v-model value when the radio is selected, similar to Angular `ng-value`. e.g.

``` html
<input type=""radio"" name=""sample"" v-model=""model.radio"" value=""1"" exp=""true"" />
<input type=""radio"" name=""sample"" v-model=""model.radio"" value=""0"" exp=""false"" />
```

If the first radio is selected, `model.radio === true` instead of `""1""`. When the model updates and `exp` is present, we match the evaluated expression rather than the `value` string when choosing which radio to set as `checked`.

**Checkbox input**
Added the ability to specify a `true-value` and `false-value` which will override the default `true`/`false` values. Similar to Angular `ng-true-value` and `ng-false-value`. e.g:

``` html
<input type=""checkbox"" v-model=""model.checkbox1"" true-value=""'someTrueValue'"" false-value=""'someFalseValue'""/>
<input type=""checkbox"" v-model=""model.checkbox2"" true-value=""expression1"" false-value=""expression2""/>
```

If present `true-value` and `false-value` will be evaluated on the current scope, and set as the v-model value when the checkbox changes. Similar to the radio, if the model changes a comparison is made against `true-value` and `false-value` values to determine the checkbox state.

I want to propose to add this badge to the README to show off inline-documentation: [![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue.svg)](http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue)

The badge links to [Inch CI](http://inch-ci.org) and shows an evaluation by [InchJS](http://trivelop.de/inchjs), a project that tries to raise the visibility of inline-docs. Besides testing and other coverage, documenting your code is often neglected although it is a very engaging part of Open Source.

So far over 500 **Ruby** projects are sporting these badges to raise awareness for the importance of inline-docs and to show potential contributors that they can expect a certain level of code documentation when they dive into your project's code and motivate them to eventually document their own.

I would really like to do the same for the **JavaScript** community and roll out support for JS over the coming weeks (early adopters are [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever), [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [Shipit](https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit)).

Although this is ""only"" a passion project, I really would like to hear your thoughts, critique and suggestions. Your status page is http://inch-ci.org/github/yyx990803/vue

119,closed,adding control directive,ghost,"This directive is an attempt to decouple as much of the DOM as possible from our ViewModel. With this directive you can set a control for the ViewModel scope with a specified key. Therefore instead of doing (using jQuery for quick example):

``` html
<div id=""demo"" v-on=""click:fadeIn"">
    <div class=""sub-control"">{{ message }}</div>
</div>
```

``` js
var demo = new Vue({
    el: '#demo',
    data: {
        message: 'Hello Vue.js!'
    },
    method: {
        fadeIn: {
            var el = $(this.$el),
                // what if our class name changes??
                subControl = $('.sub-control', el);

            subControl.fadeIn();
        }
    }
})
```

You can do this instead:

``` html
<div id=""demo"" v-on=""click:fadeIn"">
    <div v-control=""sub-control"">{{ message }}</div>
</div>
```

``` javascript
var demo = new Vue({
    el: '#demo',
    data: {
        message: 'Hello Vue.js!'
    },
    method: {
        fadeIn: {
            // does not care what class is, references controls key instead
            $(this.$controls['sub-control']).fadeIn();
        }
    }
})
```

Currently the directive will accept all letters, numbers, and `-_` characters as key values for the $controls object.

118,closed,Implements plugin parameters,bpierre,"Small change: every additional parameters is passed to the function instead of a single `options` param. As a consequence, `this` is set to the current ViewModel if the plugin is a function.

Tell me if that’s OK, otherwise I will change it to respect what you said in #88. I will also make a pull request on https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org.
